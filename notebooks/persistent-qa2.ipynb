If you want your class to work through STEM Labs or Activities together at a relatively uniform pace, it is important to think ahead about how you will engage those students who finish building earlier than others. This article provides several suggestions for meaningful learning activities they can complete as the rest of the group finishes building.\\xa0 Have Early Finishers Help Other Students One way early finishers can put their skills to good use and learn while doing so, is by providing building help to students who need it. It's important to work together with your class to establish guidelines for student helpers, so they are able to provide assistance that helps their classmates to learn without stepping in too much and doing the building for them. Have a class discussion about what giving and receiving help from peers should look like and sound like, and create the guidelines together\", metadata={'source': 'Engaging Students Who Complete a VEX GO Build Quickly', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content='Here are some suggestions for the kinds of guidelines that you could establish with your class. Helpers  Help only those who ask for help. Help students in the order on the sign-up sheet. Ask questions to be sure what kind of help is needed. Provide suggestions for solving building problems, but do not touch the robot/build.  Students who need help  Ask a helper for help first, before asking the teacher. Be patient and wait your turn. Be specific about the building problem you need assistance with.\\xa0 Try the suggestions provided by the helpers, and ask more questions if needed. Do not expect helpers to do the building for you!  Creating a protocol for classroom helpers ahead of time will ensure that both the helpers and those who are being helped are challenged and engaged. Helpers will need to think carefully about how to communicate effectively, and those who are being helped will still need to use the information provided to engage in the productive struggle required when solving problems', metadata={'source': 'Engaging Students Who Complete a VEX GO Build Quickly', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content='Additionally, creating a sign-up sheet to establish in what order students will be helped can help prevent disagreements about whose turn it is. Once you have established your classroom helping protocols, have students role play the helping procedure to practice it before they actually begin building in your classroom. This will go a long way towards helping students to employ the procedure successfully. Have Students Complete Choice Board Activities      The Choice Board in VEX GO STEM Labs offers students the opportunity to display voice and choice in their learning. The activities in the Choice Board can be used throughout the Unit, and are great options for students to explore if they are finished building before others.\\xa0   Have Students Complete VEX GO Activities      There are a number of GO Activities students can do independently using pieces remaining in the GO Kit after a build is completed', metadata={'source': 'Engaging Students Who Complete a VEX GO Build Quickly', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content='Students can be directed to choose from a list of these Activities, or can be assigned specific Activities depending on current learning goals.

Kit Exploration The IQ Pneumatics Kit can be broken down into 5 different functional categories. These categories include the following and are listed in order of importance from the initial pressurization of air and ending with the actuation of mechanical parts:   Air Stowage: This pertains to the components responsible for storing and distributing the pressurized air within the system, like the Air Pump and the Air Tank', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the IQ Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"Fittings: This category includes the various types of fittings such as the Tee Fitting and Straight Fitting that connect and route the Tubing throughout the system.  Tubing: This includes the tubes that transport the pressurized air throughout the system.  Electronic Control: This category includes components like the Pneumatic Solenoid that control the operation of the pneumatic system electronically.  Cylinders: These dual-action cylinders (2x Pitch Stroke and 4x Pitch Stroke Pneumatic Cylinders) create mechanical movement through the use of compressed air.      Product   Description     Air Stowage      Air Tank 70mL       The Air Tank acts as a backup system for your pneumatics, storing extra air. When multiple parts of your pneumatic system (the cylinders) all demand air simultaneously, the Air Tank steps in. It reduces the system's total reliance on the Pneumatic Pump. It's a crucial component in maintaining a consistent and dependable operation of your pneumatic system\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the IQ Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"Air Pump       The Air Pump, which you can recognize by its gray rectangular shape, works like an engine by compressing air and mainly sends it to the Cylinders through the Solenoid.  The Cylinders can't produce any force on their own, so they need the Air Pump's help. The Air Pump also sends some of the compressed air to the Air Tank. By doing this, it keeps your entire pneumatic system running smoothly and efficiently, especially when the demand is high.     Fittings      Tee Fitting       The Tee Fitting, which is easy to recognize because it looks just like the letter 'T', helps send air from one place to two different spots in your pneumatic system. This gives you the power to send air to different places at the same time, like helping multiple cylinders work together or managing more complicated routes. Using the Tee Fitting, you can come up with really creative and flexible designs for your pneumatic system\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the IQ Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"Straight Fi          The Straight Fitting allows you to connect two pieces of Tube together, and is also an anchor for your Tubing, making sure your pneumatic system stays put and doesn't move when running. By attaching the Tubing firmly to your structure, the Straight Fitting helps control and keep the flow of pressurized air steady. The Straight Fitting is as simple to use as pressing the Tubing into it and guiding it where it needs to go. It makes building your system easier and more reliable. \\xa0      Tubing      4mm Tubing       The 4mm diameter Tubing in your IQ Pneumatic Kit is very important. It works like veins, moving pressurized air from one part to another.  You can cut the tubing to any length you need with scissors, so it's perfect for any project. The tubing links different parts of your pneumatic system and helps it work smoothly. By adjusting the length of the tubing, you can make the best use of space in your robot's design\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the IQ Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"By adjusting the length of the tubing, you can make the best use of space in your robot's design.

It receives instructions from your Robot Brain and turns them into pneumatic actions by directing compressed air to the cylinders. It can control up to two cylinders at the same time, directing air to make each cylinder extend (push) or retract (pull). This part is key in managing how your pneumatic system works. \\xa0      Cylinders      2 Pitch Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder        The IQ Pneumatic Kit comes with two types of Pneumatic Cylinders: the 2x Pitch and 4x Pitch.

It is a valuable resource for anyone using the kit to kickstart their pneumatic projects. This guide offers the necessary information to get your system operating smoothly. For guidance on coding your V5 Pneumatics Kit, view this article from the VEX Library. Kit Exploration The V5 Pneumatics Kit can be broken down into 7 different functional categories. These categories include the following and are listed in order of importance from the initial pressurization of air and ending with the actuation of mechanical parts:   Reservoir: this includes components related to the influx and storage of compressed air in the system.  Pressure Monitor: this includes devices used to regulate and monitor the air pressure in the system.  Fittings: this category is for various types of connectors and plugs used to join tubes together or to connect them to different parts of the system', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"Tubing: this category is for components related to the flexible tubes that carry the air in a pneumatic system.  Manual Control: this category contains devices that allow for manual control of the airflow in the system.  Electronic Control: this category is for components that provide electronic control over the system.  Cylinders: this is where the mechanical work happens in a pneumatic system. Cylinders use the energy of the compressed air to create motion.     Product Description    Reservoir     Air Tank    The Air Tank is a cylindrical vessel for storing pressurized air. It has two ports which can accept different fittings. One port would contain the Value Stem which serves as the inlet. The other port will be used as an outlet and can accept one of the other fittings listed below. The Air Tank can be attached to your robot or project using zip ties. Remember, just like you'd need to recharge a battery when it's running low, you need to refill the Air Tank when it's low on air\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"And, just like turning off a machine when you're done using it, you should also let the air out of the tank after you're done.     Valve Stem    The Valve Stem is a small gold colored part that looks like the pressure inlet on a bike or car tire (formally called a Schrader Valve). It's important for getting your pneumatic system ready to go. You can screw it securely into the Air Tank or the Straight Female Fitting using its M5 thread. This is a one-way valve that lets air in, but not out, meaning as soon as you remove your pump from the valve, it closes to keep the air in. You can release the air from your Air Tank by pushing the pin in the center of the Valve Stem.     Pressure Monitor      Air Pressure Regulator     The Air Pressure Regulator in your system is like a control knob for the air pressure. Adjusting the air pressure allows the Cylinders to operate at a constant force as the pressure in the Air Tank decreases\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"For example, if the Air Tank is initially pressurized to 100psi, the pressure in the tank reduces with each actuation of a Cylinder. Without a pressure regulator, the force of the Cylinder will not be consistent - it will reduce as the pressure in the Air Tank reduces. If you set the regulator to 50psi for example, the force of the cylinder will be consistent for all actuations until the Air Tank pressure drops below 50psi. So by regulating the pressure, the Cylinders will operate with less force, but with more consistency. You will also get more actuations from the Cylinders before the air runs out. You can connect parts called fittings to the regulator's inlet (where the air comes in denoted by an embossed triangle) and outlet (where the air goes out). Then, you can change the pressure of the air that's leaving by turning the black dial. This makes sure that the pressure doesn't go above a certain limit\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"This makes sure that the pressure doesn't go above a certain limit.     Air Pressure Regulator Bracket    The Air Pressure Regulator Bracket is used to mount the Air Pressure Regulator to your robot. Remove\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"sure that the pressure doesn't go above a certain limit.     Air Pressure Regulator Bracket    The Air Pressure Regulator Bracket is used to mount the Air Pressure Regulator to your robot. Remove the black nut near the knob of the Air Pressure Regulator and slide the bracket on. Then replace the nut and tighten to hold the Air Pressure Regulator to the Bracket. The Bracket can be attached to your robot using standard VEX hardware.     Air Pressure Gauge    The Air Pressure Gauge in your system is like a meter that tells you how much pressure is in the Air Tank, or system depending where it is mounted. It's usually put before the Regulator and helps you see the total pressure. The Gauge has an M5 thread, so you can connect it to the Straight Female Fitting or straight into any M5 hole, like one on the Air Tank.      Fittings     Straight Male Fitting    The Straight Male Fitting is used when you need to connect Tubing to an Air Tank, Air Pressure Regulator, Solenoid or Cylinder\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='Screw the M5 thread into the device that you need to connect to the Tubing. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing.     Elbow Fitting    The Elbow Fitting is similar to the Straight Male Fitting, but the Tubing exits at a 90-degree angle. The M5 thread can be screwed into the device that you need to connect the Tubing to. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing. The Elbow Fitting also has a mounting hole which can be used for securing it to your robot.     Air Flow Valve Fitting    The Air Flow Valve Fitting is used to control the speed at which your Air Cylinders move. Unlike the Air Pressure Regulator which controls the force of the Air Cylinder movement, the Air Flow Value controls the flow rate which affects speed', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='The Air Flow Value is usually fitted to a port on the Air Cylinder for which you want to control the speed.     Tee Fitting    The Tee Fitting, which is named for its \"T\" shape, lets you connect 3 pieces of Tubing together in your pneumatic system. For example, you might use it to connect the Air Tank, Air Pressure Gauge and use the third outlet to supply air to the rest of the system. The Tubing is a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing. The Tee Fitting has two mounting holes which can be used for securing it to your robot.     Straight Female Fitting    The Straight Female Fitting is used when you need to connect a male M5 thread to a piece of Tubing. For example, the Air Pressure Gauge can be connected using this part. The male M5 thread of the device can be screwed to the female thread of this fitting. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing.     4mm Plug    The 4mm Plug, which has a solid black tube on one side and a small handle on the other side, is a useful tool for closing off open ends in your pneumatic system. It fits tightly into any Pneumatic Fitting that isn't being used and is the same size as your tubing. This is useful for parts like the Solenoid where unused outputs could let air escape. Instead of having to reroute extra tubing with a Tee Fitting, you can put this plug straight into a Fitting to stop the airflow. This makes sure all the pressurized air stays in your system, providing a way to save space and use your system efficiently.    Tubing    Tubing Cutter    The Tubing Cutter, an important part of your pneumatic toolkit, is used to cut your Tubing to just the right lengths. Its triangular blade makes clean, straight cuts, which helps prevent air from leaking out\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"Its triangular blade makes clean, straight cuts, which helps prevent air from leaking out.

To use it, you put your Tubing in the cutter and squeeze it to make a neat cut. Don't forget to be careful with the cutter because the blade is sharp. This tool helps make your system work as well as possible.     4mm Tubing    The 4mm Outer Diameter x 2.5mm Inner Diameter Polyurethane (PU) Tubing in your Pneumatic Kit works like the veins in your pneumatic system, moving pressurized air from one part to another. Just like how veins carry blood in our bodies, this tubing moves air around in your setup. Tubing can be cut to any length using the Tubing Cutter.     Manual Control     Shut Off Valve Fitting     The Shut Off Valve Fitting has a tap which can be used to turn the air flow on and off. The Shut Off Valve Fitting is marked with an arrow which denotes the direction of airflow. Be sure to connect the Value to your system so that the air flows in the correct direction\", metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='Be sure to connect the Value to your system so that the air flows in the correct direction. You can control the flow of air by turning the top dial: when it\\'s turned so it\\'s making a \"T\" with the flow, the valve is closed, and when it\\'s turned so it\\'s in line with the flow, it\\'s open. Closing the valve prevents air from flowing to the rest of the system which can prevent air loss when not in use and allow you to ensure the system is safe.      Electronic Control     Double Acting Solenoid    The Double Acting Solenoid is controlled by your V5 Brain. You can code your robot to direct air to one of the two outlets on the Solenoid, which are typically used to either extend or retract a Pneumatic Cylinder. You can connect either the Straight Male Fitting or Elbow Fitting to the ports on the Solenoid which then allow you to connect Tubing to carry air to the rest of the system. There are two ports marked P, one on each side of the Solenoid. This is where the pressurized air supply is connected', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='This is where the pressurized air supply is connected. You can use the other P port to connect the pressurized air to other parts of your system. The pressurized air can be directed to either port A or port B and is controlled by your code. There are two exhaust ports labeled R where the waste air exits when the Air Cylinder is moving. These ports are a through hole, meaning both are joined together. For more information on the uses and applications of the Double Acting Solenoid, view this article from the VEX Library.     Double Acting Solenoid Driver Cable    The Double Acting Solenoid Driver Cable links the Double Acting Solenoid to the V5 Brain of your robot. One end of the cable has a 3-wire plug which connects to a 3-wire port on the Brain. At the other end are two sockets which are connected to each of the plugs on the Solenoid', metadata={'source': 'Understanding the V5 Pneumatics Kit Components', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='At the other end are two sockets which are connected to each of the plugs on the Solenoid. The connector with the black and red wires should connect the the side of the Solenoid labeled A, and the connector with the green and white wires should connect to the side of the solenoid labeled B.     Cylinders     25mm Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder    The Pneumatic Cylinder, which comes in three sizes in the Kit, turns pressurized air into a back-and-forth motion and can extend (push) and retract (pull) because it has a dual-acting feature. The \"stroke length,\" or how far the cylinder moves in one cycle, is different for each size, so it can fit different project needs. You connect the Cylinder to the Tubing using a Straight Male, Elbow Pneumatic Fitting, or Air Flow Valve Fitting. This makes a setup that turns air pressure into movement.

Some examples of goals you may want to achieve include:  I want the design to be able to intake Red Blocks and score them. I want the design to remove Blocks from the Supply Zone. I want the design to be very mobile.              You could also make a chart with the constraints on your design', metadata={'source': \"Getting Started with VIQRC '23-'24 Robot Design: Full Volume\", 'row': 10}), Document(page_content='You could also make a chart with the constraints on your design.  Some examples of constraints you may have to consider include:  Only can use less than or equal to 6 IQ Smart Motors. Fit within an 11” wide x 20” long x 15” high (279mm x 483mm x 381mm) volume. Only be built from the VEX IQ product line.        It is important to lay these questions out, not only for the sake of remembering them, but also to stay on track. With infinite combinations of connections, it can be hard to remember exactly why you started once you have started. Listing your goal and all the limiting factors can help to ensure you create what you originally wanted. Design, Create, and Iterate Knowing your goal and constraints sets the stage for designing your solution. Before building, it is important to have a plan. Build Instructions offer a very specific and detailed plan for a build. When free building, plans can be looser, but should involve some kind of sketch of what it is that you are trying to build', metadata={'source': \"Getting Started with VIQRC '23-'24 Robot Design: Full Volume\", 'row': 10}), Document(page_content='This means practice creating a mental model of your idea, transferring that to paper, then matching', metadata={'source': \"Getting Started with VIQRC '23-'24 Robot Design: Full Volume\", 'row': 10}), Document(page_content='can be looser, but should involve some kind of sketch of what it is that you are trying to build. This means practice creating a mental model of your idea, transferring that to paper, then matching your drawing to actual pieces from the Kit.  Once you have laid out what you want to achieve with your build and the factors directly in between you and that goal, it is then a balancing act. You must find the perfect balance between your constraints and your goals to create what exactly you set out to achieve. Do not be afraid to try new things! It is important as you experiment with these possible solutions and builds that you do not follow one specific path. With an almost infinite combination of parts in the Kit, there is definitely more than one approach to your problem!

How the GPS Sensor Works in VRC Over Under in VEXcode VR      The GPS (Game Positioning System) Sensor, uses the VEX Field Code on the interior of the Field to triangulate X, Y position and heading. That checkerboard pattern in the Field Code is used to identify the location for each individual block in that pattern. The VEX GPS is an absolute position system, so it does not drift nor does it require calibration on a per-field basis. To sense the Field Code, the VEX GPS Sensor, a black and white camera, is mounted on the rear of the robot and faces rearwards. The GPS Sensor reports the (X, Y) coordinates of the center of rotation of Striker on the Field, in millimeters or inches', metadata={'source': 'Identifying Location Details Using the GPS Sensor in the VRC Over Under Playground', 'row': 35}), Document(page_content=\"Identifying (X, Y) Coordinates on the VRC Field The VRC Over Under Field in VEXcode VR ranges from approximately -1800mm to 1800mm for the X and Y positions.

If you need more information to determine which sensor may be the problem, read the article(s) below related to the sensors on your robot', metadata={'source': 'Troubleshooting IQ (1st gen) Sensors', 'row': 54}), Document(page_content='VEX IQ (1st gen) Sensors:   Using the VEX IQ (1st gen) Gyro Sensor\\xa0 Using the VEX IQ (1st gen) Distance Sensor Using the VEX IQ (1st gen) Color Sensor Using the VEX IQ Bumper Switch Using the VEX IQ Touch LED  Once you have identified which sensor is causing the unintended behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check the hardware on the robot to be sure that the sensor can function as intended. Each of the following hardware considerations could be affecting the functionality of your sensor. Check Sensor Placement      Begin by looking at where the sensor is located on your robot. Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like another part of your robot? Ensure that the sensor has the space needed to operate as intended.

Historically this transition from blocks to text-based programming can feel to students like learning an entirely new language, where they cannot apply the logic they had previously learned using blocks.1 VEXcode VR Switch was developed in order to facilitate that transition from block-based to text-based programming. This article will cover how to use VEXcode VR Switch and walk you through a classroom scenario to explain and illustrate those features in context.  Using Switch Blocks Switch incorporates familiar elements of block-based programming and integrates text-boxes where text commands can be typed.

Once the blocks are converted to Switch, students can easily change parameters and begin to understand the syntax of the text command. This section will walk you through a student's use of Switch to explain how you can use these blocks in a VEXcode VR project. Switch is available with a VEXcode VR Premium license.

Switch in the Classroom Austin is a student who has been coding with blocks for several years. While some students in the class are still new coders, Austin wants to learn more about Python and how to move into coding the VR robot using text. Ms. Hunter, the Computer Science teacher, noticed that Austin was ready for an additional challenge and introduced Switch to help scaffold Austin's learning and introduce text-based coding. Ms. Hunter demonstrated some of the basics like converting a block and opening the Help to learn more about the Switch Python command for each of the blocks.\\xa0 Today Ms. Hunter assigned the Coral Reef Cleanup activity to the class. She uses VEXcode VR for her coding classes because she knows that she can differentiate her instruction and reach students of varying coding levels with the same activities.

Converting a Single Block to Switch Convert 1 block                      Now that Austin has a project he has tested and verified works, the next step is to convert a block to Switch in order to begin exploring Python.\\xa0  Blocks can be converted to Switch by long pressing or right clicking on the block, then selecting the ‘Convert to Switch Block’ option, as shown in the video here.

If you want your class to work through STEM Labs together at a relatively uniform pace, it is important to think ahead about how you will engage those students who finish building earlier than others. This article provides several suggestions for meaningful learning activities they can complete as the rest of the group finishes building.\\xa0 Have Early Finishers Help Other Students One way early finishers can put their skills to good use and learn while doing so, is by providing building help to students who need it. It's important to work together with your class to establish guidelines for student helpers, so they are able to provide assistance that helps their classmates to learn without stepping in too much and doing the building for them. Have a class discussion about what giving and receiving help from peers should look like and sound like, and create the guidelines together\", metadata={'source': 'Engaging Students Who Complete an IQ Build Quickly', 'row': 85}), Document(page_content='Here are some suggestions for the kinds of guidelines that you could establish with your class. Helpers  Help only those who ask for help. Help students in the order on the sign-up sheet. Ask questions to be sure what kind of help is needed. Provide suggestions for solving building problems, but do not touch the robot/build.  Students who need help  Ask a helper for help first, before asking the teacher. Be patient and wait your turn. Be specific about the building problem you need assistance with.\\xa0 Try the suggestions provided by the helpers, and ask more questions if needed. Do not expect helpers to do the building for you!  Creating a protocol for classroom helpers ahead of time will ensure that both the helpers and those who are being helped are challenged and engaged. Helpers will need to think carefully about how to communicate effectively, and those who are being helped will still need to use the information provided to engage in the productive struggle required when solving problems', metadata={'source': 'Engaging Students Who Complete an IQ Build Quickly', 'row': 85}), Document(page_content='Additionally, creating a sign-up sheet to establish in what order students will be helped can help prevent disagreements about whose turn it is. Once you have established your classroom helping protocols, have students role play the helping procedure to practice it before they actually begin building in your classroom. This will go a long way towards helping students to employ the procedure successfully. Have Students Complete IQ Activities There are a number of IQ Activities students can do independently using pieces remaining in the IQ Kit after a build is completed. Students can be directed to choose from a list of these Activities, or can be assigned specific Activities depending on current learning goals.
