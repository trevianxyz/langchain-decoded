These include the Pitch system for Structural products, sizing for Connector Pins, and the sizing systems for Motion products.\\n\\nfile-BKnVzhaxXY.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756471/file-BKnVzhaxXY.jpg]\\n\\nPitch is the distance between two successive corresponding points. With the VEX plastic construction system, this is one unit in a three-dimensional grid system. All normal mounting holes are 1x pitch apart (12.7 mm / 0.5\\\"). Shafts, Standoffs, Corner Connectors, Beams, and Plates are sized in integer multiples of Pitch.\\n\\nThis allows structural pieces to be referred to as the \u201cnumber of holes.\u201d Using this method, a 1x12 Beam has a width of one and a length of 12 holes. The 2x Beams and the Plates have a center row of holes running between the grid set of holes. These holes are offset by 1\u20442 a hole which allows for a multitude of additional assembly options.

Pins are identified based upon how many beams can be connected together (ex; 1x1 or 1x2), with the \\\"x\\\" in the name denoting the location of the flange. In the case of naming connector pins, the term \u201cpitch\u201d refers to the thickness of a beam (6.35 mm / 0.25\\\" thick). For example, a 1x2 Connector Pin means one side of the pin can be inserted through a single beam and the other side of the pin can be inserted through two thicknesses of beams.\\n\\nExample of using 1x2 Corner Connector file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725792/file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg]\u00a0 [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042725792/file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg]\\n\\nCorner Connectors are typically used to connect beams and plates in a perpendicular orientation. Corner Connectors come in a variety of orientations, allowing for a nearly endless number of options to create three-dimensional designs.

After completing several builds numerous techniques will be developed. Here are a few examples.\\n\\n\\nASSEMBLING TIPS\\n\\nUse a 1X Beam for extra leverage when mounting small elements on shafts. Insert the shaft into a hole in the beam above the small element then push down on the beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapped Pins can be started into a hole and then placed on a solid surface. The pin can be seated by applying a downward force on the component.\\n\\n\\n\\nRubber Shaft Collars become softer and easier to install if they are warmed by holding them in your hand for a few seconds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDISASSEMBLING TIPS\\n\\nVEX PIN TOOL\\n\\nPin tool [/hc/article_attachments/360060257272/Pin_Tool.png]\\n\\nPuller [/hc/article_attachments/360060428911/Puller.png]\\n\\nThe VEX Pin Tool [https://www.vexrobotics.com/pin-tool.html] has several features that can be used to make disassembling easy. The Puller, can be used just by placing the tool over the unwanted pin, squeezing the handles, and pulling out the pin.\\n\\nPusher [/hc/article_attachments/360060429011/Pusher.png]\\n\\nEach handle is also designed to be used for disassembly. One side is constructed to push out pins (such as a 0x2 capped connector) that the tool would normally not be able to grab.\\n\\nLever [/hc/article_attachments/360060429131/Lever.png]\\n\\nThe other side incorporates the Lever, which can be used to pry two beams apart.\\n\\nConnector Pins can be smoothly removed from Smart Motors, Sensors, or Robot Brains using a 1X Beam. Put the 1X Beam onto the pin then twist the Beam while pulling outward.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemove Connector Pins by pressing a Beam against the back of the Pin then pull the Pin out the other side.\\n\\n\\n\\nStandoffs and Standoff Connectors can be separated by pushing a shaft through the Standoff Connector.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemove Corner Connectors by inserting a metal shaft through one of the holes then pull upward.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith proper care and good building techniques, the VEX plastic construction system should last for many seasons of creating multiple robot iterations. However, small parts such as Connector Pins can become bent or broken. When this happens the parts should be discarded/recycled and replaced with new parts.\\n\\nfile-2Rw5czeGQw.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756411/file-2Rw5czeGQw.jpg]\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\\n\\nLast Updated: October 15, 2021\\n\\n * Facebook", "start_char_idx": 6286, "end_char_idx": 9282, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fe953bf-0327-4856-baf5-4f28b0957f12": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fe953bf-0327-4856-baf5-4f28b0957f12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a479a00e-4b2a-4471-98d2-c3f97a6d11b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f9d24281a64c60cba9adbc2b9f883cecb202a79c99d1ccf45336f08114de5fe"}, "3": {"node_id": "a862e117-2150-488e-88d2-d1b853bbda02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e796625867ab9c2c331cb894dff0be084a02aeaa827eff28f3253639040782a1"}}, "hash": "a17e1322cfc18ecd289f37b2541558035b5c4f5c1a0881163b32c4dd7b7968f2", "text": "Updated: October 15, 2021\\n\\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\\n\\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\\n\\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

Integrated STEM education occurs when\\n\\n * learning is viewed as an active, constructive process, and not a receptive one;\\n * student motivation and beliefs are integral to cognition;\\n * social interaction is fundamental to cognitive development; and\\n * knowledge, strategies, and expertise are contextualized in the learning experience.\\n\\nThe following will identify how Engineering Notebooks support each of these tenets of integrated STEM education.\\n\\n\\nPROMOTING ACTIVE LEARNING\\n\\nIn classrooms that utilize active learning, students engage with information along with their teacher and their peers. Engaging with information includes connecting new information with prior knowledge via a variety of methods such as reading, writing, discussing, explaining, and problem-solving. Research has shown that using tools like engineering notebooks can help students make sense of concepts while participating in active learning.1\\n\\neng-notebook-04.png [https://kb.vex.com//hc/article_attachments/8692822170772/eng-notebook-04.png]\\n\\nAn engineering notebook also serves as an ongoing record of student learning over a period of time. Having students record their thoughts and ideas is important because:\\n\\n * learning is often a slow, deliberate process2, and an engineering notebook is a reflection of that process; and\\n * applying grades to the deliberate process of learning can inhibit subsequent learning and student motivation.3\\n\\nRevisiting an engineering notebook can promote student reflection and sense-making, allowing students to be active participants in their learning process.\\n\\n\\nMOTIVATING STUDENTS\\n\\nEngineering notebooks are written in each student\u2019s own language and voice. This ownership is highly motivating for students.4 The engineering notebook also allows students to choose what they are documenting, how they are documenting, and what conclusions can be drawn from the documentation. This process allows students to become participants in the assessment process. When students are included in the assessment process, they are more engaged in their learning and teachers are presented with a more accurate representation of student learning.3\\n\\neng-notebook-02.jpeg [https://kb.vex.com//hc/article_attachments/8692828004500/eng-notebook-02.jpeg]\\nEngineering Notebooks Promote Student Interaction\\n\\nEngineering notebooks are a collaborative tool. Students collaborate in both the documentation process and also using the documentation to guide future activities. Because engineering notebooks are involved in each aspect of the engineering design process, they promote student interaction beyond documentation. Students will collaborate as they decide on improvements to make based upon the information contained in the engineering notebook. The engineering notebook can be used to help students that miss class, because students can refer to the documentation and then ask questions of their peers. Students can also share their engineering notebooks with students outside of their group.

Passive Assemblies\\n 2. Motor-Driven Assemblies\\n 3. Designing a Game Piece Assembly\\n\\nEach year at the VEX Robotics World Championship the VEX IQ Challenge game for the next year is released. In addition to this, in classrooms all over the world hundreds of creative games are developed every day. These games have unique game pieces of different shapes, sizes, weights, and purposes. In order to play with these game pieces robot designs need to have specialized assemblies.\\n\\nEffective and efficient assemblies will give a robot a competitive advantage. Game strategy analysis should be the starting point when deciding on a design. That means asking, \\\"How is the robot going to play the game?\\\"\\n\\nSome other factors to consider when deciding on a type assembly include:\\n\\n * Are there any specific game rules related to the handling of game pieces or for the robot design?\\n * Consider the level of experience and knowledge. Does it match the complexity of the design?\\n * Assessing the amount of time available to assemble the design, is there enough time for completion?\u00a0\\n\\nFor example, in the 2019-2020 VEX IQ Challenge, Squared Away, a plow could be quickly and easily be attached to a drivetrain which allows the robot to push the Cube game pieces into the Scoring Zones. Whereas, assembling linear lifts on both sides of a robot in order to carry two cubes at a time and place them on the Platforms, along with a roller claw to pick up and score the balls, would require much more planning and time to assemble.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of the VEX plastic construction system is it allows for many designs and a nearly endless opportunity for creativity. This allows for a wide variety of different types of assemblies and most likely new designs which have yet to be assembled. In order to provide a starting point, here are some descriptions of different assemblies which can be used to play a game.\\n\\n\\nPASSIVE ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nPassive Assemblies use no motors. The rules of many robotics games limit the number of motors a robot can possess. Designing a passive assembly allows the robot\u2019s motors to be used for additional functions. Passive Assemblies are moved by being attached to a drivetrain or other motor-driven assembly. They can also contain stored energy from Rubber Bands.\u00a0Passive Assemblies can be some of the easiest and quickest types of designs to assemble, although they can be very complex with manual releases and", "start_char_idx": 46511, "end_char_idx": 50269, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7169c894-b9fc-48dd-aa3f-2f643333ed95": {"__data__": {"id_": "7169c894-b9fc-48dd-aa3f-2f643333ed95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee6f0cd2-095a-48f4-ad5b-ccd004a589af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a98b6761e7494b3c6a9137d3b282fa0be654ad53c85b77d124dba51d8fdc9b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ec32045-9399-4e93-a88e-b15f8dc911ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d80ec2ef4fdec94ac0964deca3293f1b02ce238b63b3d10d665f41f9f31339a"}}, "hash": "ab75c86a81c2e6ee4b5192769e5f664afcf545e8d610adebd9d20f9313c1550b", "text": "types of designs to assemble, although they can be very complex with manual releases and re-set mechanisms.

I hope we can also all agree that persisting can be taught and learned, and that it should be one of our highest priorities as educators. Documenting persistence is an essential way to reinforce the practice of this habit of mind with your students, while emphasizing it as a shared value in your classroom and school.\\n\\nA particular project I did with my second graders comes to mind when I think about persistence. My students were super excited about the idea of having their own classroom store. It was November, so I thought this could be a great opportunity to raise some money for charity. The students could make something they could sell, practice charitable giving, and engage in some hands-on math in the process. As it turned out, a great deal of persistence was needed on both my part and theirs to make this project successful.\u00a0\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the project, my students could not agree on anything. From what they would make, to the name of the store, to who would do what role and when. Every discussion was contentious and time consuming. The math turned out to be the easy part \u2013 the social and emotional learning was much more challenging.\u00a0\\n\\nAt the time, I chose to document the academic and charitable giving parts of the project. But I could have chosen to document through the lens of persistence, which would have been a very meaningful learning experience for this particular group of students.\\n\\nIn my second graders\u2019 store project, compromising was their biggest challenge. The process of deciding what to sell involved not one (as I had planned), but four long conversations to arrive at a solution. They all had wildly varied ideas about what we could make to sell. I had to help them work through the feasibility of their ideas on the way to compromise. No, we can\u2019t make stuffed animals because of time. No, we", "start_char_idx": 63205, "end_char_idx": 66763, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3e28316-26ea-43c1-b8da-56206c5c9f3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3e28316-26ea-43c1-b8da-56206c5c9f3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "144dc9e2-c607-4b6e-bced-c4e42f27ae49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7ce0fbc7b85e9a39ab2428a90afa57f7cd2c208537d9fb02a0e443ffea94ce2"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef3caacd-6669-4fe9-8294-67be4923477b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f047f350452c3fcec1e9995d1ff9ac829451c617c684091b7b7cafa8bdcedda7"}}, "hash": "a6ea09c810fcc7f7610f544c63bb74990d9822548a2dee8d6c451e077e839029", "text": "No, we can\u2019t make stuffed animals because of time. No, we can\u2019t make a new batch of cupcakes every day because we will make the lunch volunteers insane, and no, we aren\u2019t going to get a new video game launched in three weeks.\u00a0\\n\\nStudents who are persisting can see alternative routes to solving problems. For my students, coming to this particular compromise required a whole map of alternative routes. I could have taken a moment to document each of their alternate solutions in a deliberate way \u2013 the pros and cons, the final decision, and the reasoning behind it. I could have hung them on the wall for them to examine and discuss, reinforcing for them, and any visitors to our room, how important persistence was in coming to consensus as a group.\\n\\nDocumentation is an incredibly powerful tool for building our students\u2019 ability to persist in our classrooms. When we engage in the practice of documenting persistence, we are showing our students that we value the process of iteration, and the journey of learning over perfection. It destigmatizes the making of mistakes, allowing students to discuss setbacks objectively and without judgement. It also normalizes for students the idea that everyone learns at their own pace, and a little differently.\u00a0\\n\\nWhen students can see their classmates\u2019 learning trajectories and engage in discussions about them in a matter-of-fact way, they are well on their way to building persistence. Additionally, students can use the documentation as an opportunity to support each other as well, building community in your classroom. My kids\u2019 store project would have been an excellent opportunity for using documentation of persistence for building community. In the end, by the way, they compromised by deciding to make lip balm and holiday cards. We raised several hundred dollars to donate to a local children\u2019s charity, selling to students, teachers, and parents in the mornings before school. The store was a hit \u2013 even if we did leave a trail of glitter and coconut oil throughout the school in the process!\\n\\nDocumenting the process of learning a math strategy or essay writing is fairly straightforward, but what about documenting a habit of mind such as persistence? To do so, you must find ways of documenting a process occurring over time. First, you need to find ways of drawing students\u2019 attention to the times when they are persisting. You can help students to notice how they\u00a0feel\u00a0when they are persisting, as well as how they\u00a0feel\u00a0when their persistence pays off. Also, the best documentation should provoke discussion among students about persisting and how it relates to their learning.\u00a0\\n\\nI shared\u00a0one idea [https://plc.pd.vex.com/t/documenting-persistence-in-your-classroom/294]\u00a0along these lines recently in the VEX Community. Here are a few other ideas you can use as jumping off points for documenting persistence in your own classroom:\\n\\n * For younger students create a \u201clooks like\u201d, \u201cfeels like\u201d, \u201csounds like\u201d display around the idea of persisting. Have students contribute and add specific examples to each section from their own learning over the course of several weeks. Take time to discuss them with students (morning meetings and closing circles are great places to have these conversations!)\\n\\n * Create a class concept map about what persisting is, and then have students create ongoing individual concept maps about their persistence and its effects. Be sure to make time for students to share and discuss them with each other. Revisit these concept maps throughout the year, especially after you have seen growth or persistence in a particular project. By revisiting, students can refine their ideas and reflect on their learning processes as well as products. In my store project, making a concept map of the \u201cdeciding what to sell\u201d part of the project would have been a fantastic way to reflect on persisting, as well as how to come to consensus in a group.\\n\\nconcept map", "start_char_idx": 66756, "end_char_idx": 70713, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef3caacd-6669-4fe9-8294-67be4923477b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef3caacd-6669-4fe9-8294-67be4923477b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3e28316-26ea-43c1-b8da-56206c5c9f3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6ea09c810fcc7f7610f544c63bb74990d9822548a2dee8d6c451e077e839029"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa7394a9-8fdb-4123-9bb8-c95708e9d574", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b1b122939d8c3fcea6fc603c1b67da3df428f37296be85f7d34e2d1a64ffd04"}}, "hash": "f047f350452c3fcec1e9995d1ff9ac829451c617c684091b7b7cafa8bdcedda7", "text": "as well as how to come to consensus in a group.\\n\\nconcept map [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Documenting%20Persistence%20Mind%20Map3.png]\\n\\n * Have students make traditional or digital storyboards documenting various strategies they use for a complex problem solving activity. In the store project, I could have assigned groups of students to create storyboards documenting the persistence needed in different aspects of the project \u2013 decision making, learning to create the lip balm, collecting money and making change, etc.\\n\\n * Students can create timelines of project work that show moments of persistence \u2013 each point on the timeline can be a place where students had to try a different strategy as they worked to solve problems.\u00a0\\n\\n * Have students create a \u201cPersistence Portfolio\u201d throughout the course of a semester or year that they can share with other students or their parents. We could have made a class Persistence Portfolio for the store project, and documented the persistence students showed in deciding what to make, how much to charge, and what to call the store. Not to mention the persistence they showed in learning to make the lip balm, cleaning up their messes, and at least a dozen more things!\\n\\ndocumenting persistance [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Documenting%20Persistence%20Deciding%20What%20to%20Sell2.png]\\n\\n * Involve students in choosing an image as the class symbol for persistence, such as a mountain. Make several copies of the image with space for writing inside included. Create a bulletin board or display where students can take a moment to pause when they notice themselves persisting, and document how they overcame an obstacle. Students might enjoy creating a persistence mascot (I\u2019m thinking superhero here) along these same lines.\\n\\n * Create documentation of your own persistence along with your students and share it with them periodically, or as part of an existing bulletin board or display. If I had documented the places during the store project where I had to use persistence for my students to see, it would have been a wonderful way to engage them in a discussion about persistence from a different point of view, as well as empathy!\u00a0\\n\\nWhen documenting persistence, it is important to keep it a living document, so that it doesn\u2019t just become a stagnant part of your classroom environment, or \u201ca persistence thing we did once\u201d to your students. In order for them to form a\u00a0habit, they must continue to practice, reflect, and engage with the habit of mind in an ongoing way. One way to do this, is to involve families in the development of persistence, and use your documentation as a conversation starter during parent-teacher conferences.\\n\\nYou can also assign ongoing persistence documentation as homework occasionally, as another way of getting the conversation going with parents. This can help parents understand why persisting is important, how their students are making sense of the concept of persistence, and how they can help reinforce it at home. Encourage parents to share their own persistence stories with their students. I\u2019m imagining a class persistence project where students interview their parents about ways they have had to persist in their own lives, and create artifacts to share at school. These school/home connections can help parents and students reflect together about how persistence is not just something that is useful at school, but it is a skill they will use for their entire lives.\\n\\nConsider ways to involve other classes and grade levels in your school in documenting persistence, as well. If you have a hallway bulletin board you can use, invite students from other classes to contribute their own experiences. Invite other classes to join you when students are sharing persistence portfolios or concept maps, or challenge the class next door to document a certain number of examples of persisting by a certain date. Getting the rest of your school involved in an ongoing conversation about persistence can help to ensure that students can continue to develop this habit as they move up through the grades.\\n\\nThe choices we make about what and how we document students\u2019 learning are extremely powerful, and we can use documentation not just as", "start_char_idx": 70710, "end_char_idx": 74969, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa7394a9-8fdb-4123-9bb8-c95708e9d574": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa7394a9-8fdb-4123-9bb8-c95708e9d574", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef3caacd-6669-4fe9-8294-67be4923477b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f047f350452c3fcec1e9995d1ff9ac829451c617c684091b7b7cafa8bdcedda7"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e1605ab-2515-425a-bfe7-3efa018889ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2d5ed2343417c7b8552fb2fd3bb4c4058079db8e24bd74055b6b6475f5de312"}}, "hash": "0b1b122939d8c3fcea6fc603c1b67da3df428f37296be85f7d34e2d1a64ffd04", "text": "we document students\u2019 learning are extremely powerful, and we can use documentation not just as a way of showing off finished products, but as a tool for helping students to develop the habits of mind that can provide lifelong benefits.

It sends out a tiny pulse of ultrasound with its emitter at one side of the sensor, and then times how long it takes to hear the sound reflect back the receiver at the other side of the sensor. The sensor calculates the distance based on how long the sound pulse took to make the round trip. The Distance Sensor then makes a calculation based on the speed of sound to tell the robot brain how far the nearest object is.\u00a0\\n\\nIf the surface is not flat like a curved wall or a ball, the ultrasonic wave does not bounce off of all parts equally or at the same time. The closest surface large enough to reflect back a detectable amount of the wave determines the detected distance of the object.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nCOMMON USES OF THE DISTANCE", "start_char_idx": 84001, "end_char_idx": 86995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "676d7a20-0460-4ace-b49a-8e876764b46d": {"__data__": {"id_": "676d7a20-0460-4ace-b49a-8e876764b46d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9090caa-71fa-4794-95db-87c94374515b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "886878fb50cb029f42c4634d5db95564b752aa9c949a77d26cdb3d212b7e9fdc"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f776e3e-a0fa-4209-9a71-653999789432", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1eb50bc900adfb59b60ed9370dd35e04d8c18b4cce5c73b8d4c890048c47196"}}, "hash": "6ff590f8dfc6dd5dd48fa069cef7bbe1e5c813582363e625ce8915d9d64be9cf", "text": "USES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR:\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386891/5dc33fc31bf5e.png]\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386911/5dc33fc3c5405.jpeg]\\n\\nThis sensor can detect if there is an object in front of it.\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372892/5dc33fc595c4b.png]\\n\\nThis sensor can measure the distance between it and an object.\\n\\n\\n\\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive a certain distance away from an object.\\n\\n\\n\\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive up to an object without touching it.\\n\\n\\n\\n * The values provided by this sensor can be used to adjust the robot\u2019s velocity depending on whether it is near or far away from an object or surface.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nUSES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\\n\\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to initiate a sequence of behaviors when it is in the correct place to do so.

This square shape allows the shafts to fit into a square socket in the motors and provides a physical connection to drive them.\u00a0The square shape of the shafts also fits into the square hubs of motion components such as Wheels, Gears, Pulleys, and Sprockets which provides a physical drive connection to spin the components. These shafts are available in a number of selections, each with different features and options:\\n\\n\\nMETAL SHAFTS\\n\\nThese shafts are intended for high torque situations, such as supporting a large arm assembly.\u00a0These shafts are also found in the longest lengths of all the shafts.\\n\\n * 2x pitch length are included in the Foundation Add-on Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2531.html] and the Shaft Add-On Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3057.html].\\n * 4x, 6x, and 8x pitch lengths are available in the Super Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2500.html] or the Shaft Base Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3506.html].\u00a0\\n * 9x through 24x pitch lengths are available in the Long Shaft Add-on Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-4420.html].\\n\\n\\nPLASTIC SHAFTS, CAPPED SHAFTS, AND MOTOR SHAFTS\\n\\nThese lightweight shafts are for low-torque applications. They are available in 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x pitch sizes in the\u00a0Super Kit,\u00a0Foundation Add-on Pack, or the Plastic Shaft Base Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq-shaft.html].\\n\\nStraight shafts require a shaft collar or bushing to secure components in place.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\nCapped Shafts eliminate the need for a shaft collar on the capped side.\u00a0The cap can secure a wheel, gear, or other motion components.\\n\\nMotor Shafts include a flange that will capture the shaft when a Smart Motor is mounted directly to a 2X Beam or 4X Plate.\\n\\n\\nIDLER PINS\\n\\nIdler pins are not shafts and can not be used to drive a component. However, these pins can be used to attach wheels, gears, sprockets, and pulleys so they will be free spinning.\u00a0\\n\\nThese pins are available in 0x2 and 1x1 sizes in the Super Kit, Foundation Add-on Pack, and the Plastic Shaft Base Pack.\\n\\n\\nCAPTURING SHAFTS\\n\\nCapturing a shaft refers to fixing a component to a shaft so it will spin with the shaft, keeping a shaft from sliding back and forth within its supporting holes, or keeping a part/assembly from sliding back and forth on a shaft.\\n\\nFixing a Component to a Shaft\u00a0so it spins with the shaft is accomplished when a square hub slides onto the square shaft. The VEX Plastic Wheels, Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys all have square hubs so they are fixed to the shaft as soon as they slide onto a shaft. When an assembly uses beams and/or plates and it needs to be fixed to a shaft a Shaft Lock Plate needs to be used because beams and plates have round holes. A Shaft Lock Plate has a center square hub and attachment holes to allow pins to attach it to a structural component. The square hub of the Lock Plate fixes the component to the shaft", "start_char_idx": 92325, "end_char_idx": 95535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93b6a1ee-9626-4759-90e3-a18765f9e529": {"__data__": {"id_": "93b6a1ee-9626-4759-90e3-a18765f9e529", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "792b8a07-39ee-4798-aac0-ef9eb99552f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcb85d7b1e4efa1e40596cc63899079c4036c51b13ed74aec16c8be4f667609a"}, "3": {"node_id": "d042218e-ac5d-45fd-b402-b009818355c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3a9f7708486f3916c48d01bf8c9a1d94e80d2c84db8a6c829cd1864e73c25a2"}}, "hash": "c53d7599691fd726fc3227b0ea30d29b9ca039e5afabf77b491fba5e0b43f87a", "text": "a structural component.

A Shaft Bushing works in a similar manner. The end of a shaft is placed into the square hub on one side of the bushing and the pin side of the bushing is inserted into a hole of the opposing structure component. While there are many instances where a shaft needs to be kept from sliding back and forth, capturing a shaft which is inserted into a Smart Motor drive socket is essential or the shaft may slide out of the socket and it will no longer be driven. As mentioned previously, the Plastic Capped Shafts and the Plastic Motor Shafts have features by which they are already captured in one direction because of their design.\\n\\nfile-ZbDa33GMqs.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725372/file-ZbDa33GMqs.jpg]\\n\\nKeeping a part/assembly from sliding back and forth on a shaft can be accomplished in two different ways. One way is to place Rubber Shaft Collars on the shaft so there is a collar on each side of the part/assembly. Another way is to place a Shaft Washer or 0.25x\u00a0Pitch Spacer on the shaft and between a supporting structural component and the part/assembly. Then slide a Rubber Shaft Collar onto the shaft on the opposite side of the part to capture it from sliding in either direction.\\n\\nCapture with Rubber Shaft Collars Capture with Shaft Spacer and Rubber Shaft Collar\\n\\nfile-JY7HRnwoTc.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042755811/file-JY7HRnwoTc.jpg]\\n\\nfile-GgKEq345gl.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725332/file-GgKEq345gl.jpg]\\n\\nComponents for capturing shafts can be found in the Super Kit and the Foundation Add-On kit.\\n\\nfile-LttsliODFY.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042755831/file-LttsliODFY.png]\\n\\n\\nSUPPORTING SHAFTS\\n\\nFor many assemblies utilizing a shaft,\u00a0it is important to provide at least two parallel points of support. This can be accomplished by passing the shaft through the holes of parallel beams/plates. Another method is to use a Shaft Bushing on the shaft and inserting the pin side into a hole of a parallel supporting beam or plate. If two supports are not provided, the shaft may pivot slightly up or down on the single point of support and this will make the shaft harder to spin. The heavier the robot assembly the shaft is supporting, the more important it is to provide these two points of support. For example, a decorative hand might be assembled out of beams and specialty beams then fixed to a Shaft and Smart Motor assemble. This light assembly may only need one point of support as the motor waves it back and forth, whereas a heavy arm and claw assembly will need two points of support.\\n\\nTwo Points of Support One Point of Support\\n\\nfile-387xlIisec.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725312/file-387xlIisec.jpg]\\n\\nfile-bALr6HiLo1.jpg", "start_char_idx": 95499, "end_char_idx": 98841, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d042218e-ac5d-45fd-b402-b009818355c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d042218e-ac5d-45fd-b402-b009818355c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "93b6a1ee-9626-4759-90e3-a18765f9e529", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c53d7599691fd726fc3227b0ea30d29b9ca039e5afabf77b491fba5e0b43f87a"}, "3": {"node_id": "46989250-0d33-4f6d-9099-cbdfba47f914", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "184b20cb2720e20665c9c70afd4edc1bb7663e403c6af998c907a3b3e08ac985"}}, "hash": "e3a9f7708486f3916c48d01bf8c9a1d94e80d2c84db8a6c829cd1864e73c25a2", "text": "[/hc/article_attachments/360042755771/file-bALr6HiLo1.jpg]https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042755771/file-bALr6HiLo1.jpg\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"CHAPTER 5: BUMPER SWITCH AND TOUCH LED\\n\\n<\u00a0Return to Course [https://pd.vex.com/training/iq/introduction-to-vex-iq-2nd-gen?nextChapter=5]\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nLESSON 1: REMOVING THE CLAW FROM THE SIMPLE CLAWBOT\\n\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\nLearning Objectives Section\\n * Identify the parts of the Simple Clawbot to be removed in order to turn it back into a BaseBot\\n * Use the Pin Tool to deconstruct the claw of the Simple Clawbot\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS FOR THIS LESSON\\n\\nMaterials Needed Section\\n * A VEX IQ (2nd generation) Kit\\n * A completed Simple Clawbot\\n * A charged Battery\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nSummary Section\\n\\nThis video begins Chapter 5 of the Introduction to VEX IQ (2nd gen) Training Course.\u00a0In Lesson 1 you will learn how to remove the claw from the Simple Clawbot to transform your robot back into a BaseBot.\\n\\nView the following resources related to the concepts covered in the video as you continue your learning.\\n\\n * Using the VEX Pin Tool with VEX IQ [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/10716840441364-Using-the-VEX-Pin-Tool-with-VEX-IQ]\\n\\nFor discussions and questions, join our dedicated PD+ Community thread for collective learning and exploration.

Additionally, competition use required an expensive display on both the Brain and Controller to allow for data visualization when away from a computer.\\n\\nVEX EXP has fewer ports and lower-power motors (5.5W) that are more aligned with classroom needs. Since classroom use always has a computer nearby, the computer's screen along with VEXcode can replace the function of the more expensive screens on the V5 Brain and Controller. Lastly, only large competitions need the expensive VEXnet radio function, allowing EXP to use a more cost-effective Bluetooth solution that is robust for classroom use.\\n+\\nWill there be a new curriculum for EXP?\\nYes. VEX EXP has completely new STEM Labs. Each of the STEM Labs are centered around classroom competitions that use the game field and game objects that are part of the VEX EXP Classroom Bundle.\\n * EXP Educators Start Here [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/9834407868180-EXP-Educators-Start-Here]\\n * EXP STEM Labs [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/exp]\\n\\n\\n\\n * Teaching V5 STEM Labs with EXP Kits", "start_char_idx": 101629, "end_char_idx": 104824, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "236296df-a93c-4467-a6b8-553bc9ad78b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "236296df-a93c-4467-a6b8-553bc9ad78b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "46989250-0d33-4f6d-9099-cbdfba47f914", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "184b20cb2720e20665c9c70afd4edc1bb7663e403c6af998c907a3b3e08ac985"}, "3": {"node_id": "01c65f82-37cd-4e2c-8e54-54467b71d1b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7efb5b37e7b0e8c323ca457570b783771e61c30681a6ad18c1147ce5c0b36d9d"}}, "hash": "720a934909d69bdb74a8fbf5e4338382e3998b6878d9ec4481aac5ee0a1fe2dd", "text": "* Teaching V5 STEM Labs with EXP Kits [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416111144340-Teaching-V5-STEM-Labs-with-VEX-EXP-Kits]\\n * Teaching EXP Stem Labs with V5 Kits [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416090287508-Teaching-EXP-STEM-Lab-Units-with-VEX-V5-Kits]\\n\\n+\\nCan I still code with VEXcode?\\nYes. VEXcode for EXP is nearly identical to VEXcode V5.\\n+\\nHow are EXP kits different from V5 Classroom Kits?\\nThe main differences are that EXP allows slightly smaller robots to be built, requires less tool usage while building, and improves overall build speed. Additionally, the part selection allows for more variation in robot design without the need to cut metal parts. This allows builds to be constructed, deconstructed, put away, and re-used from class period to another.\\n\\nThe EXP Battery has almost twice the capacity of the V5 Battery, allowing for all-day classroom use.\\n+\\nWhat robots can I build with EXP?\\nVEX EXP contains a large selection of parts, so there are nearly unlimited robot designs that you can build.

In fact, the VEX EXP STEM Labs are designed to bring the excitement and engagement of robotics competitions to the classroom. VEX EXP Classroom Bundles contain game fields and game objects for this reason.\\n+\\nCan I use VEX EXP for the VEX Robotics Competitions (VRC, VEX U or VAIC)?\\nNo, the EXP Robot Brain, EXP Robot Battery, and EXP Controller are for classroom use only. However, EXP students will gain valuable knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to V5 and the VRC because the building system, sensors, motors, and coding are identical between the platforms.\\n+\\nWhat is recommended for classrooms that also compete in the VEX Robotics Competitions?\\nWe recommend EXP for the majority of the Classroom Kits so that more students can get hands-on experience with STEM and robotics. Use one V5 Competition Kit to support each of your team robots. Since all the construction parts and devices are compatible, they will seamlessly coexist in classrooms. The aluminum structural parts used for competition robots are easily differentiated from the steel structural parts in the EXP kits.

Assessment allows teachers to identify the student\u2019s current level of learning, and compare that to the desired level of learning. This communication allows teachers to fill in the gaps between realized and desired levels of learning. In thinking about assessment as communication, it makes sense to try to gather as much information as possible. That is where student-centered assessment comes into play. By giving students a role in their assessment, teachers are immediately able to gather far more meaningful and communicative information about learning.\\n\\nSo where do we begin? If we are going to involve students in the assessment of their learning, we should begin by involving them in the goal of their learning as well.\u00a0A great way to incorporate student voice and choice in assessment is through creating shared learning targets with your students.\u00a0A problem in many project-based learning classrooms is that the students are unclear [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3104982&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179203000&usg=AOvVaw2VoCo277MMf7HUzyPCKoEr] about the goal of the activity. This can often lead to confusion and then frustration for both the student and teacher. By co-creating learning targets that are from the point of view of the students, and in their language, we can also ensure that the students clearly understand what is expected. A key difference between learning targets and teacher created lesson objectives (or standards) is that learning targets are in the student\u2019s voice and from their point of view. Again, this is important because getting the students and the teachers on the same page is very important. Not only does this help students participate in assessment, it also helps to create a clear learning goal for all involved.\\n\\nHaving students engage in this discussion is also an opportunity to foster creativity. Discussing and co-creating learning targets can lead to students making personal connections, examining the lesson from a different perspective, and creating unique insights.

Our first step should be to just talk to our students via student self reporting.\u00a0Put simply, if we want to know how students are doing, we should ask them.\u00a0This seemingly obvious observation comes from the work of professor and educational researcher John Hattie. Hattie\u2019s work has identified student self reporting as an intervention that has one of the largest effects on student learning. Moreover, this intervention, as opposed to something like 1-1 tutoring, is cheap and easy to implement.\u00a0\\n\\nIn our STEM classrooms, we don\u2019t want students to get the \u201cright answer'' immediately, we want them to engage in iteration. We also don\u2019t want them to feel as if they can never get the answer \u2013 students need to have the\u00a0right level [https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/goldilocks-and-the-just-right-strategy-for-helping-students-acquire-new-content/]\u00a0of challenge. When students have opportunities to check their understanding multiple times, it provides information about their learning, while also ensuring that the task is at the correct level of difficulty.\u00a0In a STEM context, student self-assessment can be thought of as iteration or the engineering design process.\\n\\nWe know that immediately attaching a letter grade to student iteration can have a negative [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Creativity-Common-Core-Classroom/dp/0807756156&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179201000&usg=AOvVaw2McxqyMwrqRwm_Eke-QZt-] impact on student learning, motivation, and creativity. However, revisiting learning after they make mistakes can raise student learning. Student-centered assessment gives us the chance to further embed iteration into our classroom culture in a powerful way.\u00a0\\n\\nUnfortunately, most grading practices are based on tradition [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholarworks.uni.edu/elpe_facpub/3/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179200000&usg=AOvVaw0tZdQdqJwQhi7nhSZovQxN], not evidence. Everyone, including our students, wants to know the standards by which they are being evaluated. Student-centered assessment doesn\u2019t remove this \u2013 it enhances it. Students can be empowered by the assessment process, when they are active participants in it. We just need to explore how it can be done within our classroom environments.\u00a0\\n\\nWhat are some ways you incorporate student-centered assessment into your classroom?

The infrared emitter shines an invisible light and then detects its reflection.

It is important for graphic artists and any designer who works with color on a digital screen to be able to see exactly the correct color being displayed. Misunderstandings and wasted resources result when the colors are not accurate.\\n * Cameras and camcorders use color sensors to adjust settings based on the lighting conditions they are in, in order to enhance their photos and videos by maximizing light levels and enhancing otherwise dull colors. These sensors also allow a photographer to focus on specific colors in their photos.\\n * Color sensors are sometimes used in manufacturing, to quickly inspect if a product has the correct color before it gets shipped to a customer. For example, fruits and vegetables that turn colors when ripe or ready to be eaten can be scanned to ensure that they are the correct color to send to market.\u00a0\\n\\n\\nSome common uses with a VEX IQ Robot include:\\n\\n * This sensor can be used to detect the color of an object.\\n\\n\\n\\n * This sensor can be used to detect and/or follow a line.\\n\\n\\n\\n * This sensor can detect whether an object is near.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nCOLOR SENSORS ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\\n\\nRemember, it is important when detecting colors and hues that the Color Sensor have the proper amount of light to do so. Be sure to test, also known as calibrating, your Color Sensor each time you arrive at a new competition site because different levels of light can affect how your Color Sensor performs. Test your project with the lamp set at different levels to determine which is the most reliable setting for your robot\u2019s Color Sensor.\u00a0\\n\\nThe information collected by the Color Sensor is useful for programming a competitive robot to respond to a variety of conditions. The Color Sensor can make a competition robot better in the following ways:\\n\\n * It lets the robot detect the color of an object near the sensor. This is useful if you want the robot to sort differently colored objects, drive up to a specifically colored object, or detect the color of objects as they pass by the sensor.\\n * It lets the robot detect how much light is reflected back into the sensor.

The batteries are very safe. However, if they become cracked or damaged then hazardous chemicals can leak out of them. If there is an electrical short that allows the two terminals of the battery to become directly connected, this can be a very dangerous situation and cause extreme heat. The most common cause of electrical shorts are breaks in the insulation of cables or metal debris getting into the Smart Ports of sensors, motors, and brains.\\n\\nUsing an incorrect battery charger can also damage a battery.\\n\\n\\nPERSONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES REGARDING ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS:\\n\\n2020-12-08_11-48-30.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079384612/2020-12-08_11-48-30.jpg]\\n\\nDo not touch the two terminals of a battery at the same time with any part of your body.\\n\\nIf any part of your robot feels abnormally warm or hot to the touch, alert an adult immediately and move away from the robot.\\n\\nSeek immediate medical attention for any burned skin.\\n\\n\\nELECTRICAL COMPONENTS SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR ROBOT:\\n\\nIQ_GO_Batteries.png [/hc/article_attachments/360079384892/IQ_GO_Batteries.png]\\n\\nInspect your robot for any cracked or frayed cables before powering up and replace immediately if they are found.\\n\\nInspect all Smart Ports for debris or bent pins prior to plugging in a Smart Cable.\\n\\nPlace electrical tape over the terminals of batteries when they are in storage.\\n\\nUse the appropriate battery chargers.\\n\\nInspect all batteries, sensors, motors, and the robot brain for defects and damage before using, if any are found, store in a safe location and recycle as soon as possible.\\n\\nThis list of precautions and associated guidelines are not all inclusive of the safety issues associated with working on and competing with robots. They are intended to point out some of the more common safety concerns. Common sense and proper training are your best safeguards.

Planning for a STEM Lab starts by looking at the Goals & Standards section then reviewing the Summary section to get a deeper sense of the activities within the STEM Lab, and how long it might take.\\n\\nAn individual STEM Lab might take approximately 40 minutes in one classroom, while another classroom will choose to complete it over several days. Students may be excited to extend their learning with specific STEM Labs depending on their background with the material, and their personal interests. If you want to extend a STEM Lab further, you can always choose to do the activities from the Choice Board with your class.\\n\\nSTEM Labs Tile [/hc/article_attachments/360078568771/Stem_Lab_Tiles.png]\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSTEPS TO IMPLEMENT A STEM LAB\\n\\n 1.

Review the Share Section to see suggestions for making student learning visible and discussion prompts to use with your students.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nGOALS & STANDARDS\\n\\nEach STEM Lab begins with student goals and objectives to indicate what the students will be learning by the end of the Lab. These can help to frame the Lab as it is implemented in the classroom. This section of goals, objectives, and standards makes it easy to see what you are teaching and where in the Lab those skills are being taught.\\n\\nSpecific areas of the Lab (Play Part 1, Engage) are mentioned so that it is easy to see the value of each section of the Lab and pinpoint where each activity and assessment is occurring. Begin each STEM Lab by reviewing the Goals & Standards.\\n\\nGoals___Standards.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568711/Goals___Standards.png]\\n\\nEach standard identified has a detailed explanation of where the standard is being met during the Lab. All objectives and activities also align with the identified standards.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nA full materials list is available in the summary so that it is easy to gather all needed materials and prepare before beginning the STEM Lab. Each material has a specific purpose and recommendation for how many are needed for the classroom, taking the guesswork out of STEM Lab preparations.\\n\\nMaterials_Needed.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568731/Materials_Needed.png]\\n\\nThe Environment Setup section provides tips from experienced teachers on how to organize materials and prepare a space for the Lab activities.\\n\\nEngage_Play_Share_Summary_2.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568691/Engage_Play_Share_Summary_2.png]\\n\\nThe Lab Summary provides a quick overview of each section of the STEM Lab: Engage, Play, and Share.

Every image in the teacher-facing STEM Labs is included in the Lab Image Slideshow - offering ready-made visual aides, so teachers do not have to make them on their own. The slides can be displayed for students in the classroom, and offer visual context for the conversations, activities, and concepts being taught through the Lab. Teachers move through the slides as they move through the sections of the Lab, using the STEM Lab as reference material for their teaching.\\n\\nImage_Slideshow.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078432312/Image_Slideshow.png]\\n\\nThe student-facing materials of STEM Labs are intentionally minimal, as the goal of the STEM Labs is for students to be actively coding, collaborating, and engaging with STEM concepts. VEX 123 is designed to be a hands-on platform, so students are tangibly working to see STEM concepts in action, instead of just reading about them.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nIMPLEMENTING A STEM LAB - ENGAGE\\n\\nEach step in the STEM Labs is written out to make implementing in your classroom easy! The Engage section explains how to introduce the Lab and help students foster a personal connection with the Lab. Remember, the information in the STEM Lab is a teacher resource, and is meant to be taught from, not directly viewed or projected for student consumption.\\n\\nTo begin, the Acts and Asks section offers prompts for a guided discussion and demonstration to introduce the concepts explored in the Lab. The Acts give ideas for what to do, and the Asks give verbal prompts for what to say inline with each action. (Again, think of this as part of your teacher\u2019s manual, meant to be read to students, not by students.)\\n\\nEngage.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078432272/Engage.png]\\n\\nThe Engage section provides prompts for engaging students further with the Lab concepts and materials. Here you may find guided prompts for conducting an interactive demonstration or to introduce students to materials they will be using in the Lab. Each Engage section follows a consistent format: Instruct, Distribute, Facilitate, and Offer, making it easy to find information when facilitating Engage activities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nIMPLEMENTING A STEM LAB - PLAY\\n\\nEach STEM Lab follows the same format for Play sections, making it simple to introduce to your students and to explain what steps they will follow to complete an activity. Again, this material is meant as a teacher reference and should be used to aid in the facilitation of the Lab activities, not read directly by students.\\n\\nPlay_Sections.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568751/Play_Sections.png]\\n\\nPlay Part 1: In this section, you will Instruct, Model, Facilitate, Remind, and Ask students. Each prompt has specific instructions so you never have to worry about how you\u2019re going to facilitate a discussion or instruct the students to do something. Utilize these steps as you would those in a traditional teacher\u2019s manual.\\n\\nMid-Play Break:\u00a0Bring your students back together as a class! Ask students the guided questions provided to check for understanding or to clarify any student questions.\\n\\nPlay Part 2: In this section, you will Instruct, Model, Facilitate, Remind, and Ask students.

Organizing your classroom competition will help ensure its success, and make sure that you and your students are on the same page during class.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nORGANIZING YOUR STUDENTS FOR COMPETITION\\n\\n\\nIF THE COMPETITION USES TEAMS, ASSIGN TEAMS TO YOUR STUDENTS\\n\\nThe teacher should assign teams to the students, to identify which groups will work together in the competition. Post the teams in your classroom in a clearly visible space, so that students can quickly and easily see who they are working with.\\n\\n\\nCREATE A MATCH SCHEDULE\\n\\nMatches can move more smoothly if you and your students know when they are expected to be ready to compete. Most matches are 1 minute long, but you will need to allow time for setup and clean up, so that students can navigate the classroom space easily. So setting up a schedule that allows for roughly 5 minutes per match, should account for student movement, setup and cleanup.\\n\\nPost the schedule with the teams, or print it and give it out to students so that they can clearly see when they are expected to be ready. This timetable will then set the parameters for students\u2019 practice time. An example match schedule is shown below.\\n\\nScreen_Shot_2021-08-10_at_1.46.11_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/4404983099796/Screen_Shot_2021-08-10_at_1.46.11_PM.png]\\n\\nYou will want to have multiple rounds of the competition so that students can iterate on their strategy and build between matches, so establishing a time table will help you plan your class time to allow for a successful competition lesson. Having a predetermined schedule will also enable you to announce the matches throughout class, so that your focus can remain on scoring and timing at the competition Field.\\n\\n\\nCREATE A LEADERBOARD\\n\\nPost or project the match schedule on the whiteboard in your classroom, and give space for students to write in point totals and to identify the winner of each match. This visible record of matches can provide motivation for students as they continue to iterate, as well as give them an idea of other teams to scout as they develop game strategies.\\n\\nYou can also use the VEX IQ Leaderboard [https://education.vex.com/leaderboard/iq] in your", "start_char_idx": 182803, "end_char_idx": 186541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02831e68-8a7a-440c-8277-b140bbea03a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "02831e68-8a7a-440c-8277-b140bbea03a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d464355c-fea9-4257-9fc2-ce0c1ad38296", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "409e5dd6dade972a61861d028d905e0869827ad1509bf428e51fec09486ac281"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e5e7de0-4797-4326-a6fa-55ead38cd6ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "09c2a47b4cb890ebcd5fa7ec400d79432161d603d055419a25f3921e6747d8f8"}}, "hash": "2d997cf5896029d1f7f81f55eceef361431cbee92d4fcd1a811d1cf174bfd750", "text": "IQ Leaderboard [https://education.vex.com/leaderboard/iq] in your classroom.

This should be easily accessible to all students, and have enough space for students who are not in the match to observe, so that they can scout other teams. This will be the teacher\u2019s main responsibility as your matches are taking place, as you will be responsible for scoring and keeping time, so putting in a centrally located space where you can still supervise your students is optimal.\\n * A Practice Area - Have an additional Field, or taped off space, that students can use to practice for their competition matches. If space allows, you may want to have more than one practice area, so that multiple teams can practice simultaneously.\\n * Team Meeting and Preparation Spaces - Have several tables or meeting spaces available for alliances to use as their \u2018home base\u2019, or \u2018pit\u2019, throughout the competition. This will give space for documenting in their Engineering Notebook, meeting to develop game strategy, or building and iterating on their robots.\\n\\nAn example layout of a classroom space could include a centrally located competition Field, with desks pushed along one side of the classroom as Team Meeting spaces, and a practice space designated on the other side of the room. You will need to determine what works best for your setting, based on your space constraints and the needs of your students.\\n\\nkb-classroom-comp-layout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4406172889108/kb-classroom-comp-layout.png]\\n\\nIn this example, the flow within the space would be something like this:\\n\\n * The teacher would be based between the Competition Field and the Leaderboard.\\n * At the end of a match, the teacher announces the winner, and writes the scores on the Leaderboard, while the two groups that competed clear and reset the Competition Field for the next match.\\n * The teacher announces the next groups to compete, giving them a \u201c2 minute warning\u201d to the start of their match.\\n * Once the Field is cleared, the students who finished competing return their robot to the Meeting Space to strategize for the next round, and the students coming up to play can gather at the Competition Field from the Practice Space and/or Meeting Space.\\n\\nTo learn more about facilitation strategies during classroom competitions, see this VEX Library article [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404983247636-Facilitating-an-IQ-STEM-Lab-Competition].\\n\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"USING THE VEX IQ (1ST GEN) DISTANCE SENSOR\\n\\nIn this article\\n\\n 1.

It sends out a tiny pulse of ultrasound with its emitter at one side of the sensor, and then times how long it takes to hear the sound reflect back the receiver at the other side of the sensor. The sensor calculates the distance based on how long the sound pulse took to make the round trip. The Distance Sensor then makes a calculation based on the speed of sound to tell the robot brain how far the nearest object is.\u00a0\\n\\nIf the surface is not flat like a curved wall or a ball, the ultrasonic wave does not bounce off of all parts equally or at the same time. The closest surface large enough to reflect back a detectable amount of the wave determines the detected distance of the object.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nCOMMON USES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR:\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386891/5dc33fc31bf5e.png]\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386911/5dc33fc3c5405.jpeg]\\n\\nThis sensor can detect if there is an object in front of it.\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372892/5dc33fc595c4b.png]\\n\\nThis sensor can measure the distance between it and an object.\\n\\n\\n\\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive a certain distance away from an object.\\n\\n\\n\\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive up to an object without touching it.\\n\\n\\n\\n * The values provided by this sensor can be used to adjust the robot\u2019s velocity depending on whether it is near or far away from an object or surface.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nUSES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\\n\\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to initiate a sequence of behaviors when it is in the correct place to do so. For example, the robot can drive forward until it detects that it is 150mm away from a wall, then turn 90 degrees, and release an object into a scoring zone.\u00a0\u00a0\\n * The Distance Sensor can be used to trigger robot actions, such as picking up a game piece, when an object is detected within range.\\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive toward an object or surface until it is within a specific distance, without touching it. This can be used to make sure that the robot does not knock over game pieces.\\n * A robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive away from an object or surface until it has reached a specific distance. This can be used to avoid collisions with other robots on the field.\\n\\n\\nUSING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN VEXCODE IQ\\n\\n\\nADDING THE DISTANCE SENSOR AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\\n\\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_10.40.38_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13587568086420]\\n\\nTo code the Distance Sensor in VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Distance Sensor.

It can also be set to display many colors.\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042387031/5dc33fd2445b4.png]\\n\\nThe VEX IQ Touch LED Sensor is included in the VEX IQ Super Kit but it can also be purchased here [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3010.html].\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nHow the Touch LED Works: Detecting Touches\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042373032/5dc33fd3a7fe4.png]\\n\\nThe Touch LED uses technology that detects small changes in the physical properties of its surroundings. It does this by measuring capacitance.\\n\\nCapacitance is a physical property of any object. It can be affected by what a thing is made of, or what it's shaped like. The air around us has a certain capacitance, an electrical circuit has a certain capacitance, and your body has a certain capacitance.\\n\\nThe Touch LED can detect this capacitance by sending an electrical signal and noting what comes back. In the image you can see that when the button is pressed, the purple response signal changes compared to the blue input signal. If the response signal is just right, it means there is a finger present, and the Touch LED sends a message back to the Robot Brain which means that it's being touched.\\n\\nOne advantage of checking for touch in this way is that a change in capacitance does not require that you touch the circuit directly, only that you get very close. As a result, the electronics in the Touch LED can be shielded with plastic and packaged along with more electronics, like the multi-color LEDs inside the device.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nCOMMON USES OF THE TOUCH LED:\\n\\n * This sensor can be used to start or pause a program at the touch of a finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n * This sensor can be used to display different colors at different parts of a program.\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nUSES OF THE TOUCH LED ON A COMPETITION ROBOT:\\n\\n * The Touch LED can be used to start a running program with a finger press.\\n * Team members can see when different sections of an autonomous program are running by programming the Touch LED to display a unique color for each section.\\n * Using the Touch LED can also be used to help troubleshoot programming problems if issues occur.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nUSING THE TOUCH LED IN VEXCODE IQ\\n\\n\\nADDING THE TOUCH LED AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\\n\\nScreenshot_2023-03-01_at_3.25.56_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13597019988500]\\n\\nTo code the Touch LED in a VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Touch LED.

If you want a robot to drive to a location then turn around and return to the same spot, you will need to move straight for an accurate distance, turn exactly 180 degrees, then drive back straight for the same distance. A Gyro Sensor makes keeping straight and turning very accurate.\u00a0\\n\\nThis sensor measures its own rotation around an axis. Whenever this sensor is rotated in the direction indicated by the symbol on the top of it, it measures the angle of the turn. The returned measure is in degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise. As the curved arrow on the top of the sensor indicates, the values increase as the Gyro Sensor turns counterclockwise. The values decrease as it turns clockwise.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372852/5dc33fbce0dc6.png]\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nHOW THE GYRO SENSOR WORKS\\n\\nThe Gyro Sensor only detects movements that are clockwise or counterclockwise on the axis indicated on the top of the sensor. So if the gyro is mounted horizontally in the center of the robot, it does not detect if the robot is tilted downward or upward on a slope as long as the gyro hasn\u2019t turned clockwise or counterclockwise. It also does not detect if the robot is tilted or leaning on one side as long as it is still oriented forward. However, a Gyro Sensor can be mounted on a robot\u2019s side or on a manipulator and that would allow it to measure tilt.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nCOMMON USES OF THE GYRO SENSOR\\n\\nGyro sensors are integrated into many pieces of technology where knowing the orientation of a device or stabilizing an object are important.\\n\\nSome common uses in daily life include:\\n\\n * Gyro sensors are integrated into small motorized vehicles that allow the person to control speed by leaning forward and backward, while also keeping the vehicle stable.\\n * Gyro Sensors are used to stabilize large ships as well as", "start_char_idx": 215684, "end_char_idx": 219046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "091192ee-8423-4c10-acc2-654581eeaab5": {"__data__": {"id_": "091192ee-8423-4c10-acc2-654581eeaab5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ae12e41-ff5d-4a2d-86e0-96caaf21c5d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc406aac0551b62114c48bf471362b50dd707b86183528808c258abd9f0928e9"}, "3": {"node_id": "2db839b5-f5ee-4177-a8ae-1135a7bc1ef0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cacb5e842be555827ff324d203188c89e250b0e4d446f715195f73728d0f798"}}, "hash": "c3ce0e68b52ff94a94ce48895e9922ed5e50424748bf5139eef492fd1da5a1e4", "text": "* Gyro Sensors are used to stabilize large ships as well as monorail trains, in order to keep the people and cargo on them safe.\\n * Gyro sensors are used to measure movement in some handheld electronic devices, such as video game remote controls.\\n\\nSome common uses for a Gyro Sensor with a VEX IQ Robot include:\\n\\n * Detecting if the robot has turned left or right\\n\\n\\n\\n * Detecting whether the robot is tilting up or down by mounting it on the side of the robot\\n\\n\\n\\n * Maintaining straight driving\\n * Making accurate turns\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nGYRO SENSORS ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\\n\\nThe Gyro Sensor can be important for programming a robot for competitions. The gyro is especially important when programming for the autonomous period when the robot has to perform tasks without human input.\u00a0\\n\\nThe Gyro Sensor can make a competition robot better in the following ways:\\n\\n * The Gyro Sensor can detect which direction and how far the robot has turned from its starting point.\\n * The Gyro Sensor can detect if the robot is tilting up or down by mounting it on the side of the robot.\\n * The Gyro Sensor can be used to detect the status of one of the robot's components (e.g., arm up, arm down, etc) by mounting it on the manipulator or attachment.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nUSING A GYRO SENSOR IN VEXCODE IQ\\n\\n\\nUSING A GYRO SENSOR AS PART OF A DRIVETRAIN\\n\\nWhen using a Drivetrain on your VEX IQ robot, the Gyro Sensor is built into the Drivetrain, and works automatically to ensure that the robot does things like drive straight and make accurate turns.\u00a0\\n\\nScreenshot_2023-03-02_at_11.40.03_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13617760019860]\\n\\nWhen configuring your Drivetrain in VEXcode IQ, you will be prompted to include the Gyro Sensor as part of the configuration, as shown in this example image.\u00a0\\n\\nThere are many benefits to using the Gyro Sensor as part of the Drivetrain.

While there is a structure to the STEM Labs, they are designed to be flexible, so that they can easily be implemented in the time, space, and teaching style that best meets any class\u2019s needs and environment. A STEM Lab Unit can be completed in a short time frame, or easily extended to enable students to be immersed in the engineering design process, and grow comfortable with iteration, working collaboratively, and learning from mistakes. In addition, the student-facing material lends itself well to implementation in a flipped classroom, or a hybrid setting, where students can interact with the Learn content at home, then engage with the hands-on Practice and Compete sections in class.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSTUDENT-CENTERED ASSESSMENT IS EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT THE UNITS\\n\\nSTEM Lab Units are designed to bring student-centered learning to life in your classroom. Beginning with the co-creation of learning targets, students have agency over their learning, and are given multiple opportunities to reflect on and self-assess their progress. Formative assessment is embedded throughout the Lessons in the form of Check Your Understanding questions and Wrap Up Reflections. In order to make the most of this, be mindful of your classroom environment and culture, so that students are able to embrace the idea of learning from their mistakes without fear of retribution or a failing grade. The Debrief Conversation at the end of the Unit offers students a way to be an active participant in summative assessment, so that it is something done with students, not simply to them. With a classroom culture that supports iteration and risk taking, students can engage in authentic, real-world problem solving, and learn to see a failure as another opportunity to learn.\\n\\n\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"CODING WITH VEX IQ SMART MOTORS\\n\\nIn this article\\n\\n 1.

Waiting and Non-Waiting Commands\\n\\nThe VEX IQ Smart Motor has many functions to use when coding in VEXcode IQ. This can come in handy when coding arms, claws, and intakes as well as drivetrains and other mechanisms created using VEX IQ. Understanding how the motors can be coded will help to alleviate issues such as projects stalling or motors not working as intended.\\n\\n\\nMOTOR ENCODER\\n\\nNot only does the VEX IQ Smart Motor turn electrical energy into mechanical energy, as most motors do, it also has features that most motors do not have, which make it \u201csmart.\u201d One of its main features is the quadrature encoder. This encoder is mounted on the interior of the motor in order to track the speed and/or the position of the motor shaft.\\n\\nReports from the VEX IQ Smart Motor\u2019s encoder make it possible to know:\\n\\n * The direction of the motor\u2019s turn (forward/reverse or open/closed)\\n * The position of the motor and the amount of the", "start_char_idx": 229666, "end_char_idx": 233459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c720a09-be1c-4304-a2f8-ce0d672f053d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c720a09-be1c-4304-a2f8-ce0d672f053d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e91ef0d7-3412-4255-af8d-cac02ee1b72c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "07393b9f8c266bff230167fc36ebd84878e5c87f5ff883d01e259f5ef3f6f8e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb57e2e0-01da-4bb4-9267-c18c774982b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "95aae5a90070c7743f127c6d986548af1c72e676c69202cec25978009eaf9c78"}}, "hash": "2ad9e3bdfdd86625be89c4db2760c37ad20bfd3bf97f0b7776bd6233b1534b72", "text": "or open/closed)\\n * The position of the motor and the amount of the motor\u2019s turn and position (either in turns or degrees)\\n * The speed of the motor\u2019s turn (based on the encoder\u2019s position over time)\\n\\nBecause the encoder reports the motor\u2019s states, they can be used in behind-the-scenes calculations to make many of the Motion and Sensing commands work within the VEXcode IQ.\\n\\n\\nCODING INDIVIDUAL MOTORS\\n\\nBefore beginning to code individual smart motors in VEXcode IQ, you need to configure the motor. Individual motors are frequently used for additional mechanisms like intakes, arms, and claws. However all of the information does still apply to other mechanisms using individual motors.\\n\\nimage7.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089828282388]\\n\\nFollow the steps in this article [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035953011-Configuring-Smart-Motors-in-VEXcode-IQ] to configure your individual motor in VEXcode IQ.\\n\\nWith a single motor configured, commands to control that motor will appear in the Toolbox. You will notice there are different types of commands: waiting and non-waiting.\\n\\n\\nWAITING VERSUS NON-WAITING COMMANDS\\n\\nNote that all of the images here show blocks. All of these projects can be rebuilt in Python or C++ and contain the same functionality as blocks.\\n\\nimage3.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780437652]\\n\\nWaiting commands block the project from continuing until the behavior is completed. These include commands such as [Spin for] and [Spin to position].\\n\\nThe project shown here uses a Clawbot (2-motor) template and all of the commands are waiting. So in series, the claw motor would close 90 degrees, the robot would drive in reverse, then the arm would spin up to reach position 180 degrees.\\n\\nimage6.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780557204]\\n\\nIn contrast there are non-waiting commands. A non-waiting command will execute the behavior indefinitely or until told to change to another behavior. These include commands such as [Spin].\\n\\nThe project shown here uses a BaseBot with an intake added. Here the intake motor would begin to spin. The [Wait] command is a waiting command, so the intake would continue to spin until the 2 seconds were up, then move to the next command in the project which is a [Stop] command. Then the motor would stop spinning.\\n\\n\\nMOTOR TIMEOUTS\\n\\nWhen coding a motor as part of an arm or claw, it is important to remember the difference between waiting and non-waiting blocks and how those will impact the movement of your robot. Motor timeouts allow you to set a time limit for the motor to reach the intended target position. If it has not met that position when time expires, the motor will stop trying to spin and the project will move to the next command.\\n\\nimage2.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780385684]\\n\\nIn this example, the motor timeout is set to 2 seconds. If the claw does not close to 90 degrees within 2 seconds, the motor will stop spinning at the 2 second mark then move to the next command and drive forward.\\n\\nimage4.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089829215124]\\n\\nIf you are unsure of how far to move a motor, use the sensor dashboard. The dashboard reports the position of the motor in degrees and revolutions, so as you move a motor (like opening and closing a claw) the numbers will change. Use this testing to determine how many degrees or rotations is needed to close a claw, raise an arm, spin an intake, etc.\\n\\nSee these articles to learn how to use the sensor dashboard.\\n\\n * Viewing Device Info - VEX IQ (1st generation)", "start_char_idx": 233418, "end_char_idx": 236963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb57e2e0-01da-4bb4-9267-c18c774982b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb57e2e0-01da-4bb4-9267-c18c774982b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c720a09-be1c-4304-a2f8-ce0d672f053d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ad9e3bdfdd86625be89c4db2760c37ad20bfd3bf97f0b7776bd6233b1534b72"}, "3": {"node_id": "231c0bf5-689b-4162-abd1-d595a03f3e9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e0c31f060d06016ff9cc2c659f4d9f8ca5a08f3b5ef199ba34252b8cd246a7d"}}, "hash": "95aae5a90070c7743f127c6d986548af1c72e676c69202cec25978009eaf9c78", "text": "* Viewing Device Info - VEX IQ (1st generation) [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4963914797204]\\n * Sensor Dashboard with VEX IQ (2nd generation) [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908]\\n\\n\\nCODING SMART MOTORS AS PART OF A DRIVETRAIN\\n\\nBefore beginning to code a drivetrain in VEXcode IQ, you need to configure the drivetrain including the motors used.

STEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities offer varying levels of facilitation and scaffolding. They can be implemented individually or in combination to best match your teaching style and the needs and interests of your students.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nWHAT STEM LABS, ACTIVITY SERIES, AND ACTIVITIES ARE\\n\\nThe VEX 123 platform contains educational resources to support the incorporation of meaningful learning experiences into your existing curriculum.

All VEX 123 resources can be used flexibly, and adapted to suit your teaching style, comfort level with coding and Computer Science, and your students\u2019 needs. However, each offering has a different level of teacher involvement embedded into it.\\n\\nimage4.png [/hc/article_attachments/4402326105108/image4.png]\\n\\nFor a more step-by-step, guided lesson experience, STEM Labs are like your online teacher\u2019s manual. Similar to a printed teacher\u2019s manual, the teacher-facing content of the STEM Labs provides all of the resources, materials, and information needed to be able to plan, teach, and assess with VEX 123. Students see the Lab Image Slideshows as their teacher facilitates the Lab, while the teacher has all the discussion prompts, activity steps, and facilitation strategies at their fingertips. STEM Labs are an ideal way to build student engagement and establish best practices in your classroom for using VEX 123 together.\\n\\nOnce your students are comfortable using and taking care of their 123 Robots and materials, 123 Activities are a great way to give students the opportunity for more independent exploration. As student-facing documents, Activities do not require much teacher facilitation. Activities fit well in a Learning Center, as an extension activity for a STEM Lab, or as a Choice Time activity for students to practice a variety of skills with VEX 123.\\n\\nActivity Series sequence multiple Activities, with some teacher facilitation notes and contextualization, to offer a flexible lesson that can easily be used in a variety of settings. Activity Series give teachers a narrative from which to base their lesson, and gives students the opportunity to bring that narrative to life using their 123 Robots. Activity Series can work well as shorter lesson engagements, but do not have a time frame associated with them. They can also be easily stretched to create a more immersive experience by drawing on the use of the 123 Field and Art Ring. These engagements can help to bring students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s creativity to their coding projects.\\n\\nSTEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities can be used separately or in conjunction with one another, to infuse Computer Science concepts and practices into your curriculum. The Pacing Guides in each STEM Lab identify strategies to support implementation and reteaching, including connections between the Lab content and Activities.

He has seen a growing interest in his students, and a natural curiosity and affinity for robots and technology, but his school does not have devices available for Kindergarten. Charlie was delighted when he learned about VEX 123, seeing it as the perfect opportunity to infuse Computer Science into his classroom, without needing student devices. As a bit of a coding and Computer Science amateur himself, he was especially glad to see the curricular resources available for him to use.\\n\\nCharlie introduced VEX 123 to his students with the Meet Your Robot STEM Lab Unit.

The content of the STEM Labs also tied in well to his literacy curriculum, as he was working on sequencing and decoding simple words to read and write them. At this point, his students were confidently able to use their 123 Robots with growing independence, so Charlie could then add the Activities connected to the STEM Lab to a Learning Center, and offered this as a Choice Time and early morning engagement.\\n\\nimage1.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/4402326105748/image1.jpg]\\n\\nAs Charlie\u2019s students were learning to read and write simple sentences, storytelling was becoming a bigger part of their literacy time in the classroom.

These features include:\\n\\n\\nDETECT AN OBJECT\\n\\nfound_object_block.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407488885012/found_object_block.png]\\n\\nThis feature allows your robot to detect an object when it becomes within the range of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen). The Distance Sensor (2nd gen) will report a found object when it is approximately less than 1000mm away.\\n\\nThe example project shown on the left is used to code a robot with a Distance Sensor (2nd gen) mounted on the front to turn until it detects an object, such as a cube, and then drive forward once the object is detected by the sensor.\\n\\n\\nDISTANCE TO AN OBJECT\\n\\nobject_distance_in_mm.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407489361300/object_distance_in_mm.png]\\n\\nThis provides a measurement between the front of the sensor and an object or a barrier/wall.\\n\\nThe example project shown on the left is used to code a robot with a Distance Sensor (2nd gen) mounted on the front and a claw attached. The robot will drive until it detects an object is less than 75mm away from the sensor, then close the Claw around the object. This example would be helpful if it is known that there is an object in front of the robot and you want the robot to drive forward to collect that object.\u00a0\\n\\nTo determine how far away an object is from the sensor and use that parameter in the project, use the Sensor Dashboard on the IQ (2nd generation) Brain. See this article for more information about using the Sensor Dashboard. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREPORT OBJECT VELOCITY\\n\\nvelocity_example.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407490435220/velocity_example.png]\\n\\nThis feature provides a measurement of the velocity in meters per second for an object approaching the sensor, or the sensor approaching an object.\\n\\nIn order to observe the velocity changing with an approaching object, the example to the left can be used. In this project, information will be printed to the Brain's screen. The Brain will print when an object is detected by the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) and the velocity of that object in meters/second. To more accurately see those changing numbers, the print precision is set to 0.1.\u00a0\\n\\nTest this project by moving a cube closer and further away from the sensor. When the object and/or sensor are moving away from one another, the velocity values will be negative.\\n\\n\\nDETERMINE OBJECT RELATIVE SIZE\\n\\nsize_of_object.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407491843604/size_of_object.png]\\n\\nThis feature allows your robot to identify an object as being small, medium, or large depending on the sensor\u2019s reading.\\n\\nThis example to the left uses [If then else] and [Print] blocks to print the relative size of an object on the Brain. Place various objects in front of the sensor and look at the readings on the Brain's screen to see the size identification in real time.\\n\\nTo determine the relative size of an object, the sensor uses information about the amount of light being reflected back at the sensor.

These STEM Labs are written for use with VEX IQ (1st generation) Kits. SPARK STEM Labs follow a sequence of learning experiences. The learner is asked to do the following:\\n\\n * Create a build or an artifact.\\n * Explore the build or the artifact and speculate as to its possible application in the real world.\\n * Learn by doing.\\n * Make changes to a design or a build to improve and enhance it.\\n * Assess knowledge.\\n\\nIn the Seek section, students build their robot by following a set of build instructions. Then students move into the Play sections where they follow guided instruction to explore the new skill or concept introduced. In Apply, students will read about the real world and competition connections to the concepts they are learning about. In Rethink, students are given a challenge. They will need to apply their knowledge from Play and work collaboratively with their groups to solve the challenge.

The purpose of the VEX Library is to help VEX users quickly find information about VEX products, services, or topics. The VEX Library offers self-service support content around multiple topics and themes.\\n\\n\\nVEX CAMPS\\n\\nCamp.png [/hc/article_attachments/5836302084628/Camp.png]\\n\\nSTEM Labs and Activities do not need to be limited to a traditional classroom setting. VEX Camps [https://camps.vex.com/] can be offered all year around, from summer enrichment or fall fundraisers to winter break offerings or spring family fun days. This option is great if you want to provide students or community members with an extra way to get involved with engineering and coding in a fun and engaging way.\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSUGGESTED PLANNING STRATEGIES\\n\\nThe VEX IQ platform can be well executed in a variety of ways, thus making it a valuable tool in a variety of learning environments. These highly engaging STEM materials give it a significant role in the success of a school and its students and teachers.\\n\\nConsider the following as you plan to implement VEX IQ in your educational space:\\n\\n * What is your time frame and/or setting? STEM Labs can give you ideas for how to guide students through creating a project or experimenting with a build. Activities can give you ideas for more independent student explorations or challenges. Are there any space constraints that you have that might affect your activities?\\n   * Use the VEX IQ Pacing Guide [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmNfN8X9Trpr8UhcZAGPa-akSaPDrFxsoluerQ0AMQk/edit#gid=277290212] to help you plan your curriculum like in the examples below:\u00a0\\n     * If you are teaching a one semester beginner VEX IQ class, you may want to start with the Beginner IQ STEM Labs and corresponding VEX IQ Activities.\\n     * If you are teaching a one semester advanced Robotics class, you may want to do a quick refresh of skills by completing a few Activities, and then move into more intermediate/advanced STEM Labs such as Castle Crasher or Clawbot with Controller.\\n     * What balance of direct instruction and open-ended or hands-on exploration do you wish to have? Will you give students an Activity to follow on their own, or will you guide them through the experience as a whole group?\\n * How will students be introduced to the concept or project? Will you use the setup of a STEM Lab to help you engage students, or will they watch a tutorial video to begin class? What prior experience can you draw on to help your students make a personal connection to the lesson content?\\n * How will you wrap up class? Will there be a closing ceremony for the end of the classroom competition? How will students express their voice and choice to share their learning?\\n\\n\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"\\n\\nUSING THE VEX IQ BUMPER SWITCH\\n\\nIn this article\\n\\n 1.

They can also be celebrations of learning, and even hubs of activity where students can actively participate in their evolution as their learning progresses. There are many things that we can share through documentation on our bulletin boards and walls, but when we think about what the real purpose of that documentation is, it likely boils down to a few main ideas:\\n\\n * Create a classroom environment that is a welcoming space reflective of who is in it\\n * Make student learning visible to students and stakeholders (parents, administrators, visitors to our classroom)\\n * Foster student learning by providing a tangible way to learn from ourselves and others\\n\\nIt may seem at first like these are fairly lofty goals for a classroom bulletin board. No matter how crafty or thematic we make our walls, in many instances, they are a passive part of the environment. Sometimes this is what is needed, but other times, we can leverage documentation to support student learning and agency.\\n\\n\\nDOCUMENTATION AS DISPLAY\\n\\nMaking the learning in our classroom visible to students and stakeholders is important. When my principal entered my classroom, I wanted her to know immediately what kinds of projects we were working on. Students want to have a way to share their work with parents when they visit. Displays are a great way to do that, as they tell a story of learning that has occurred. For instance\u2026\\n\\nVEX 123 Dragon in the Village bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/documentation-as-display.png]\\n\\nHere we have a visually appealing memory of the Dragon in the Village Activity Series. There are images of the children working, artifacts from their coding using printables and photos, and words of the students self-describing something they learned. A visitor to the classroom could see that students were using a 123 Robot, and they would be able to see how engaged they were and what they had done to code the robot. Students can see themselves reflected here, and have a recap of what they did during this project.\\n\\nThe presentation itself is very teacher driven, and while the voice of the student is there in some ways, it is presented through the eyes and perspective of the teacher. This is showing a finished product, rather than an evolution. While this communicates something about student learning and creates a welcoming space, it doesn\u2019t necessarily propel learning further.\\n\\n\\nLIVING DOCUMENTATION\\n\\nA \u2018living\u2019 piece of documentation grows and evolves as student learning grows and evolves. Typically, it starts simply, leaving visual and physical space for artifacts and traces of student learning. This style of documentation eases the \u2018setup\u2019 burden on the teacher, and is generally done at the start of a project, rather than the end. For instance\u2026\\n\\nguiding questions bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/living-documentation.png]\\n\\nHere we can see many similar items, yet the presentation is shifted. Instead of presenting the product of students\u2019 learning, the evolution of the process of their learning is here.

We can see what \u2018big ideas\u2019 have been agreed upon, what students are trying to figure out, and the materials they are using to be able to do so. There are additional items, like students\u2019 journal pages, teacher\u2019s recorded conversations, and saved project collections that can help prompt students to see how their thinking has changed, by giving them tangible reminders of what they previously thought through these artifacts.\\n\\nThe presentation, while clearly organized by the teacher, is accessible to students and has components that they can interact with, like the project archive, printables, and activities. The balance of voice between student and teacher is more balanced.\\n\\nThis space is welcoming, reflective of learning, and begins to foster learning by giving students a physical space to revisit their previous knowledge, and a physical space to show what they are currently learning and working through.\\n\\n\\nINTERACTIVE DOCUMENTATION\\n\\nLike living documentation, the space grows and evolves. However, with interactive documentation, the students are the ones that are primarily contributing to the space. Interactive documentation can be used to have students share progress over a longer term investigation or project, but (particularly for younger students) it is often used for smaller, more focused parts of a project. For instance\u2026\\n\\nprogress bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/interactive-documentation.png]\\n\\nHere we can see that the \u2018setup\u2019 is very simple, and almost like a learning center. The guiding question for the space is open-ended, and one that will allow for a variety of student responses, as there isn\u2019t just \u2018one\u2019 right answer. The goal of this space is to show active student learning \u2013 to create a hub where students can learn from each other as much as from their own experience.\\n\\nLearning is documented and shared through the voice and perspective of the students themselves. This is a space that they add to, interact with, take tips and tricks from (physically and cognitively), and their answers evolve over time. When the \u2018tips\u2019 are no longer needed, (as determined by students and teachers together) they can be archived to make room for more pressing tips and tricks. This kind of documentation might be part of a larger bulletin board, or just a functional small piece on its own. Either way, once students learn how to interact with it, it is essentially their space to use.\\n\\nWhen we think about the walls of our classrooms, many things come to mind \u2013 they are probably filled with images, charts, reminders, rules, and student work. We want our classrooms to be places that students are happy to be in, where they feel welcome, and where they see themselves reflected. The walls of our classrooms will reflect the action of the community within it, and hopefully the learning that is taking place as well. Creating spaces that feel welcoming, make learning visible, and foster student problem solving and deepening understanding is not a simple task, but it is one that can be incredibly rewarding and valuable. The walls of our classrooms don\u2019t need to be just a passive backdrop, they can themselves be an active part of the learning environment.\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"DESCRIPTION OF THE SENSOR\\n\\nThe IQ Optical Sensor is a combination of the following sensors:\\n\\n * Ambient light sensor: Reports the current amount of ambient light that the sensor is detecting.

Her teaching style is firmly rooted in learning through play, and as such, her classroom spaces and Learning Centers lend themselves to hands-on activities. Over the years, Sara has been actively incorporating more unplugged coding and computer science related activities into her curriculum. This year, Sara added VEX 123 to her classroom, to bring those coding concepts to life in a different way. Her students quickly adopted the 123 Robots into their classroom community, and Sara has eagerly seized the opportunity to engage in longer term investigations with the 123 STEM Lab Units.\\n\\nsara-kindergarden-123-activity.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360084755491/sara-kindergarden-123-activity.jpg]\\n\\nHowever, in the midst of working through the Role Play Robot Unit, a stomach bug spread in Sara\u2019s class, and each day different students were home sick. Sara turned to the Pacing Guide for the Unit, to get ideas for how to keep her whole class engaged and on track, and found the \u201cActivities to support reteaching\u201d were ideal for her situation. The Pacing Guide linked two Activities, so Sara set up one in her 123 Learning Center for the week. Upon returning from being home sick, she made sure each student worked on that Activity during their Morning Center Time. She used the second Activity as a whole class instructional moment, pausing the STEM Lab, to work in this additional lesson. This gave Sara the opportunity to keep the whole class connected to the ideas and concepts of the STEM Lab, despite their varying attendance. The class not only sustained their momentum, but actually got more excited about coding monsters and pets to have emotion codes, in addition to coding their own feelings in the STEM Lab!\\n\\n \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"\\nWHY DO STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO LEARN FRACTIONS?\\n\\nBy Lauren Harter\\n\\nSeptember 29, 2022\\n\\n\\n\\nIf anyone asked me, which mathematical concept do you think is the hardest for students to learn?

What does that mean? It means there are different conceptual meanings of fractions: ratio; operator; quotient; and measure 3. Understanding fractions as part of a whole is interwoven throughout these four categories.\\n\\n * A ratio is a comparison between two numbers, such as two programmers for every three engineers in a robotics team. The ratio is 2:3, where the programmers represent \u2156 and the engineers represent \u2157.\\n * A fractional operator essentially scales the value (decreases it or enlarges it). For example, \u00bc of a number can be the function of multiplying that number by 1, and then dividing it by 4.\\n * A quotient is essentially division. \u00be is three divided by four.\\n * Measurement is describing the measurement of an interval. This can really be understood better when you think about the interval between 0-1, and how fractions make up everything in between this interval.\u00a0\\n\\nstock image [/sites/default/files/inline-images/AdobeStock_418077895.png]\\n\\nBecause teachers more often than not teach fractions only by memorization (to divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal), instead of ensuring students fully understand these different conceptual meanings, students become stuck in misconceptions, such as\u00a0\\n\\n * Students think that the numerator and denominator of the fraction are two completely different numbers (that they are unrelated).\\n * Students think that fractional operations should be handled just like any other number. For example, 1+1=2, and with that same logic, add straight across the numerator and denominator 12+12=24 (which we know is incorrect).\\n\\nIn light of all this, it is easy to see why students find fractions so difficult to understand. They are significantly more complex than 1+1- 2. They have more conceptual meaning and can be very difficult to show concretely.\u00a0\\n\\nVEX provides different activities, STEM Labs, and videos to help students practice learning with fractions in ways that emphasize those difficult to grasp abstract concepts.

Existing classrooms can mix 1st and 2nd generation kits.\\n+\\nCan I mix generations in the same classroom?\\nYes. All of the 2nd generation electronics are compatible with the original 1st generation electronics and vice-versa. This was done to ensure classrooms with mixed 1st and 2nd generation equipment would not have any compatibility issues. Brains, Controllers, Sensors, Motors, and Batteries can be mixed in any combination between 1st and 2nd generation of IQ. The only difference in the generations is that the 2nd generation battery has a new charger. The 2nd generation battery will not charge with the 1st generation charger, and accidentally inserting the 2nd generation battery into a 1st generation charger will not cause any damage either.\\n+\\nCan I use the old curriculum?\\nA new generation of STEM Labs will be available by Fall 2021; however, the development team is working to provide guidance for using all IQ STEM Labs with either the IQ 1st generation or IQ 2nd generation hardware.\\n\\n\\nGENERAL FAQS\\n\\n+\\nHow are the VEX IQ 1st and 2nd generations compatible?\\n * Everything works with everything (except chargers)\\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with both IQ Robot Batteries (1st and 2nd)\\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with both IQ Controllers (1st and 2nd)\\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with all IQ Sensors and the Smart Motor.\\n * The 1st and 2nd generation batteries use different chargers. The 1st generation Battery Chargers will not harm or charge the 2nd generation batteries. The 2nd generation charger connects via USB-C.\\n\\n+\\nCan I still code with VEXcode?\\nYes. You can now use VEXcode [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode] for Python, along with Blocks and C++.\\n+\\nCan I still code with ROBOTC?\\nNo. ROBOTC could not be upgraded to the newer technology in IQ Robot Brain (2nd Generation). Users will need to use VEXcode. Learn more about VEXcode. [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode]\\n+\\nDo I still need to use the IQ VEXos Utility?\\nNo. VEXcode for Windows, Mac, and ChromeOS performs all firmware updates. Additionally, the IQ Robot Brain (2nd generation) does automatic firmware updates to all connected devices at any time, without the need to reconnect to a computer. Simply update the Robot Brain and all other components will automatically be updated, even if they are connected at a later time. The IQ VEXos Utility will continue to be available for the IQ Robot Brain (1st generation).\\n+\\nHow has the gyroscope sensor been improved over the original Gyro Sensor?\\nThe gyro in the 2nd generation is now located inside the Robot Brain.

The VEX IQ Smart Motors have perhaps the best performance and sensing of any snap-together robotic system available. Nonetheless, users could want the motors to move things faster, lift heavier things, or move mechanisms far away from the motor. VEX IQ Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys can allow these requirements to happen.\\n\\nGears Sprockets Pulleys 228-3502-rev2.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049025451/228-3502-rev2.jpg] 228-2534.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048892552/228-2534.jpg] 228-3508.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049025491/228-3508.jpg]\\n\\n\\nOUTPUT/INPUT RATIOS\\n\\nWhen discussing the VEX Plastic Gears/Sprockets/Pulleys there are some standard terms which are used:\\n\\n * Driving/Input - This is the Gear/Sprocket/Pulley placed on the shaft a Smart Motor is forcing to spin.\\n * Driven/Output - This is the Gear/Sprocket/Pulley placed on the shaft of the component (such as a wheel or an arm) which will be forced to spin from the input.\\n * Rotational Speed - This is how fast a shaft is spinning, commonly measured in how many times it spins in one minute, also known as, revolutions per minute (rpm).\\n * Torque - This is the amount of force needed to rotate a load at a distance. For example, it takes more torque to rotate a longer arm or when there is more weight placed on the arm. It also takes more torque to rotate a larger diameter wheel, or when a wheel is moving something heavy. Torque is commonly measured in the metric unit which combines force and distance call the newton-meter (Nm).\\n\\nThere are two principles which will help users understand how to use VEX Plastic Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys:\\n\\nIncreased Torque: When the input Gear/Sprocket/Pulley (component) has a smaller diameter than the output component, this will increase the output torque of the system. However, it will proportionally decrease the output rotational speed of the system. In other words, if the motor can not lift an arm, the motor needs to have a smaller component driving a larger component on the arm\u2019s shaft.\\n\\nGear Increase Torque Sprocket Increase Torque Pulley Increase Torque IQ_Increase_Torque-Gear.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086792/IQ_Increase_Torque-Gear.png] IQ_Increase_Torque-Sprocket.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086812/IQ_Increase_Torque-Sprocket.png] IQ_Increase_Torque-Pulley.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049212211/IQ_Increase_Torque-Pulley.png]\\n\\nIncreased Speed: When the input component has a larger diameter than the output component, this will increase the output rotational speed of the system.

It is important to realize when using output/input ratios these do not take into account friction and other factors in the robot\u2019s system.\\n\\nFor instance, it might be tempting to build a 1:5 gear ratio for the drivetrain so the robot will move very fast (500 rpm). There are several factors which make this impractical. First, the 60 teeth gears are larger than the standard 200mm Travel Wheels so the gear will hold the wheel off the ground. In addition, the output torque will be so small (0.08 Nm) the Smart Motor may not be able to move the wheel/robot. Even if it were possible to use this ratio, if the robot were to move at five times its normal speed it would be very difficult to control.\\n\\nThis example illustrates how when using output/input ratios the objective is to find a \u201csweet spot\u201d balance between torque and speed. It is also important to make sure the components will fit into the robot\u2019s design.\\n\\nVEX Plastic Sprockets have five different sizes of Sprockets (8 Tooth Sprocket, 16 Tooth Sprocket, 24 Tooth Sprocket, 32 Tooth Sprocket, 40 Tooth Sprocket) which can be combined. The VEX Plastic Pulleys have four available sizes (10mm, 20mm, 30mm, 40mm).\\n\\n\\nPOWER TRANSFER\\n\\nVEX Plastic Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys may also be used for power transfer. This is needed when a design does not allow a Smart Motor to directly drive the shaft of a wheel or other component.

If all the gears are the same size, the motor can drive any one of the gears.\\n\\nPlease note when using gears within a drivetrain it is important to have an odd number of gears between the wheels. This is because when one gear drives another, they rotate in opposite directions.

Some of these include:\\n\\nGears: Gears are one of the most reliable of the three choices of components. Unless there is too large a span between the supports of the gear shafts allowing the shafts to flex enough for the two gears\u2019 teeth to separate; with gears, when the input gear spins, the output gear will spin. However there are some drawbacks:\\n\\n * Gears have to be arranged at fixed distances from one another so the teeth of one gear intermesh with the teeth of the next.\\n * Gears need to be aligned in a straight line to one another. (Noted exception: to mix \\\"Primary\\\" 12/36/50 tooth gears with the \\\"Secondary\\\" 24/48 gears. The secondary gears need to be either offset by half a pitch, or need to use the extra middle hole in even-length 1x Beams).\\n * As mentioned before, an odd number of gears in a line will have the input and output gears spinning in the same direction, and an even number will have the input/output gears spinning in opposite directions.\\n\\nMixing \\\"Primary\\\" 12/36/60 tooth gears with the \\\"Secondary\\\" 24/48 gears\\n\\nMixing_IQ_Gears.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049043371/Mixing_IQ_Gears.jpg]\\n\\nSpecial note: When using a gear ratio, only the input gear size and the last output gear size need to be considered. Any gears in between those two gears only transfer the motion and their sizes have no effect on the gear ratio.\\n\\nVEX Plastic Gears also have a Crown Gears which will allow for a 90o connection between gears. There are also Worm gears [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2532.html] and a Differential & Bevel Gear Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/differential-and-bevel-gear-pack.html] which allow this.\\n\\nCrown Gears Differential & Bevel Gears Worm Gears IQ_CrownGear.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049117971/IQ_CrownGear.png] 228-4418-app.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048893892/228-4418-app.jpg] blue.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048893872/blue.jpg]\\n\\nIn addition, VEX Plastic Rack Gears from the Gear Add-on kit will allow for linear motion.\\n\\nRack Gears", "start_char_idx": 386008, "end_char_idx": 389365, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "173a9846-9cb4-4676-8039-a4664b81b2d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "173a9846-9cb4-4676-8039-a4664b81b2d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd7140e3-43ef-4ee4-8a2f-9c57bbda7e6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "45431b3aaccecb5c1e25dad5531d210567b47addf997c5c96fc60a76c0e1591e"}, "3": {"node_id": "c89dd6e2-f67a-490d-af2e-5d45adccb267", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "463ab01d73c657de3fda922d23fe11acadb8892bd5194523c72c21bb8263b2f4"}}, "hash": "00bdd917775068186e949ba57012dfce3cf0d914300fe5914eb67e012cf643c4", "text": "the Gear Add-on kit will allow for linear motion.\\n\\nRack Gears IQ_Rack_Gears.png [/hc/article_attachments/360048988072/IQ_Rack_Gears.png]\\n\\nSprockets: Sprockets are also a good option. Their shafts can be separated at any number of different pitch distances because the chain is assembled from individual snap-together links which can be put together in custom lengths. The input Sprocket and output Sprocket will always be spinning in the same direction. The driving Sprocket should have at least 120o of chain wrapped around it or the chain can skip teeth on the Sprocket. Sprockets can also be connected together with Tank Tread.\\n\\n\\n\\nPulleys: Pulleys are intended for light loads. They are limited by the distances they can be separated by the lengths of the available Rubber Belts (30mm. 40mm. 50mm. 60mm). Like Sprockets, the input Pulley and the output Pulley spin in the same direction. The Rubber Belts for the Pulley system are smooth. The belts will slip if the load the system is trying to move is too large. (Note: rubber belts can be crossed over to reverse the output pulley direction.)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether the robot design uses Gears, Sprockets, or Pulleys, there are a large choice of options to change the output/input ratio or power transfer of the VEX IQ Smart Motors.\\n\\nSafety Hazard:\\nfile-rXVRcJFkVw.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042569232/file-rXVRcJFkVw.png]\\n\\n\\nPINCH POINTS\\n\\nBe sure to keep fingers, clothing, wires, and other objects from getting caught between moving components.\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"LESSON 5: DRIVE IN A SQUARE\\n\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\nLearning Objectives Section\\n * Identify how to open a template in VEXcode IQ\\n * Identify how to code the robot to turn left and right for a specific number of degrees in VEXcode IQ\\n * Construct a VEXcode IQ project to code the Speed Build to drive in a square\\n * Identify how to download a project to the IQ (2nd gen) Brain and run it for testing\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS FOR THIS LESSON\\n\\nMaterials Needed Section\\n * A VEX IQ (2nd generation) Kit\\n * A completed Speed Build\\n * A charged Battery\\n * Access to VEXcode IQ\\n * 4 VEX IQ Field Tiles\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nSummary Section\\n\\nThis is the final video of the Introduction to VEX IQ (2nd gen) Training Course - Chapter 1.

When we use them together in deliberate and strategic ways, they become a powerful part of our practice. We can interlace them to help students reflect on both their learning and the learning of others, to inspire new understandings. We can use them to help students learn to communicate more clearly about their ideas and their current understandings as well. And, they can help students to visualize what the next steps in their learning trajectory should be.\u00a0So what would interweaving modeling, documentation, and feedback look like as students prepare for a classroom competition, such as in an IQ (2nd gen) STEM Lab?\\n\\nAll of the IQ (2nd gen) STEM Labs provide the kind of rich project work that affords the maximum benefit from interweaving modeling, documentation and feedback. Let\u2019s imagine we are about to begin the IQ (2nd gen)\u00a0Up and Over STEM Lab\u00a0 [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/iq/up-and-over]with students.\u00a0\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\n * As you go through the process of\u00a0co-creating learning targets [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/5525737110548-Co-creating-Learning-Targets-with-Your-Students]\u00a0with your students, select a learning goal or two that you most want to emphasize. Although you are going to create several learning targets, don\u2019t dilute the process by trying to focus your attention on all of them at once!\u00a0\\n\\n * Consider selecting one target that is an essential engineering or coding target your students need to focus on, and one that is geared towards building students\u2019 learning capacities. In our Up and Over example, the selected targets could be:\\n   * I can design an effective claw for competing in the Up and Over Competition.\\n   * I can collaborate with my teammates to create a strategy for the Treasure Hunt Competition.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nModeling\u00a0\\n\\n * Now that you have chosen learning targets to focus on, take some time to think thoroughly about exactly what outcomes you want your students to achieve. For example, if you know your students have no experience in designing an effective claw, you may want them to gain the fundamental understanding that before beginning to design, they must consider the size, shape, height, and weight of the", "start_char_idx": 392551, "end_char_idx": 395958, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "144f48ad-0009-4eb6-9056-6b5c1b609f0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "144f48ad-0009-4eb6-9056-6b5c1b609f0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c89dd6e2-f67a-490d-af2e-5d45adccb267", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "463ab01d73c657de3fda922d23fe11acadb8892bd5194523c72c21bb8263b2f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9343ab50-4daf-4d8d-8a83-168898408d4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b768b254f016727195a67d6b2b90285524ca3c3ba84aadcd3d98f453c47ceb27"}}, "hash": "7cea1a40b56c40d4fadc3ea27f06fe08a0fe7191a6603ea1cc7e00b5d0bc894b", "text": "before beginning to design, they must consider the size, shape, height, and weight of the object they are designing for.\u00a0\\n\\n * Then, after your students have viewed the Claw Design video in Lesson 2, explicitly model\u00a0the process of thinking\u00a0about designing for the size, shape, height and weight of the object they are going to move with their claw - the IQ Cube. Pretend you are working on the first iteration of your claw design and narrate the process, thinking aloud about the decisions you are making and why. Make sure to explicitly model considerations about the size, shape, height, and weight of the IQ cube as you go.\u00a0\\n   * Keep in mind that you don\u2019t need to model designing the \u201cperfect\u201d claw!\u00a0You are modeling a thinking process and not a product.\u00a0It\u2019s fine to leave room for iteration and improvement.\\n\\nConnecting Modeling to Documentation\\n\\n * Additionally, model how you would draw and document your first claw iteration in an Engineering notebook, calling out what you would like to see in their notebooks! If you\u00a0show\u00a0your students how to label their drawings to communicate how they consider the size, shape, height, and weight of the IQ cube, they are much more likely to consider this design question fully and make\u00a0their\u00a0documentation of this iteration more thorough!\\n\\n * Think of it this way: If you want to see something in students\u2019 engineering notebooks, be sure they see you modeling it!

But, it can also be a communication catalyst that allows students to provide constructive feedback for one another in an organic way.\u00a0\\n   * Allow time for students to view and discuss each other\u2019s engineering notebooks.\u00a0They can generate their own questions about other students\u2019 designs, or you can guide them to ask questions about certain aspects of their thinking process (e.g., How and why did you decide to make your claw that size? What made you change your design in that way?)\\n   * Consider having students display engineering notebook pages that demonstrate progress towards the understanding you are focusing on.\u00a0When students display their work in progress, the work becomes a form of communication that can provoke new understandings in other students, and build students' sense of being part of a community of learners. In the essay, \u201cCreativity as a Quality of Thought\u201d, Carlina Rinaldi shares, \u201cRepresenting our learning process and being able to share with others becomes indispensable for that reflexiveness which generates knowledge.\u201d\u00a0\\n   * Weave more modeling in by demonstrating for students how to provide specific feedback to each other that can help further learning!\u00a0You can do this explicitly as well as implicitly, by making sure when you are providing feedback you are doing just that.\\n\\n * Consider having your students create additional forms of documentation they can share with other students and with you to document their learning. For example, using our Up and Over STEM Lab Unit, students could:\\n   * Interview each other about how their claw design improved over time as they iterated on a design that takes size, shape, height and weight of the IQ cube they are designing for into account. Share the video and use a jumping-off point for a class discussion.\\n   * Use data from the\u00a0VEX IQ Leaderboard [https://education.vex.com/leaderboard/iq]\u00a0to create a display that connects that data to specific claw design iterations that shows how they are related. Have other students comment on this display, or use it as part of your Debrief Conversation at the end of the STEM Lab.\\n   * Have students write sports journalism inspired articles about their Classroom Competitions, with your desired understanding as a framework. \u201cHow Team SuperClaw used Engineering Design to Win it All in the Up and Over Competition!\u201d\u00a0\\n", "start_char_idx": 395925, "end_char_idx": 400068, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9343ab50-4daf-4d8d-8a83-168898408d4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9343ab50-4daf-4d8d-8a83-168898408d4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "144f48ad-0009-4eb6-9056-6b5c1b609f0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cea1a40b56c40d4fadc3ea27f06fe08a0fe7191a6603ea1cc7e00b5d0bc894b"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a6b7599-981d-4e3d-98f5-2a22d6c1aa1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea23d18215fd38b4983d39307eb91a525325ec9c49475ddfc14b137f168fbe50"}}, "hash": "b768b254f016727195a67d6b2b90285524ca3c3ba84aadcd3d98f453c47ceb27", "text": "Engineering Design to Win it All in the Up and Over Competition!\u201d\u00a0\\n   * The possibilities are endless!\\n\\nfeedback [/sites/default/files/inline-images/teacher-with-students.png]\\n\\nUsing Documentation and Feedback to Inspire Next Steps!\\n\\n * When you give students feedback in the form of suggestions for improving work, make it go further by including examples of how to do this.

(You will have come full circle!)\\n\\nTaking a big-picture look at how modeling, documentation, and feedback are connected, and how we can employ them strategically to bring out the best in our students academically and socially is definitely worth the time and effort.

The robot itself, the engineering notebook, and even the code behind the robot are tangible, visible representations of student learning. The STEM connections could not be more clear. However, robotics teams also support students in other areas as well, and these intangible skills, like collaboration, teamwork, and communication are just as important (if not moreso), as the science, technology, engineering, and math they are engaging in. While only some robotics students may go on to STEM related careers, all of our students, whether on robotics teams, or a part of classroom competitions, will have to learn to navigate complex cooperative and collaborative environments in their futures. These life experiences, from college to career to family life, will rely on students\u2019 ability to leverage their social-emotional learning in order to be successful in work and in life.\\n\\nOne of my favorite \u2018organizers\u2019 for thinking about the so-called \u2018soft skills\u2019 that lay a foundation for learning are the Habits of Mind. Developed by Costa and Kallick, the Habits of Mind are described as \u201ccharacteristics of what intelligent people do when they are confronted with problems, the resolutions to which are not immediately apparent.\u201d These 16 characteristics are rarely used in isolation, but instead are interwoven throughout students\u2019 experiences and learning. Depending on the situation, certain Habits of Mind may feature more prominently than others, but rarely is there a case where only one is used by itself.\u00a0\\n\\nWe have talked about several of the Habits of Mind in PD+ videos [https://pd.vex.com/videos/playlist/habits-of-mind], Community conversations [https://plc.pd.vex.com/t/documenting-persistence-in-your-classroom/294], and Insights articles [https://pd.vex.com/insights/documenting-persistence]. Some of the Habits, like persistence, have obvious connections to robotics. Yet nothing brought home the holistic nature of the connection between competition robotics and the Habits of Mind like attending the VEX Robotics World Championship last month.\u00a0\\n\\nThis graphic from The Habits of Mind Institute outlines the 16 Habits of Mind:\\n\\nHabits of Mind", "start_char_idx": 406494, "end_char_idx": 409813, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d24d9b-57c4-4c25-a3cb-1b144216424f": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d24d9b-57c4-4c25-a3cb-1b144216424f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecd2a495-ba33-412c-b1e5-69a58287a9d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "92e08b878ccadabea23bf9bbf055a73b26a853351b108b52de6ba0d825a8c0f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a225f93-b35a-4e30-ac2e-422454ff4eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a231743c234174c789d229b16b3c6465ff47aaa996619fc60893db0e37a5bcac"}}, "hash": "5813897f43d0a1d794f2779ff107aeb63e966b39612f64537e778f829994ac40", "text": "Institute outlines the 16 Habits of Mind:\\n\\nHabits of Mind [/sites/default/files/inline-images/pEW0dfQA0v3O2jmhdVPzDmVr7P3Vu043BLRtsAAa3sH3Z0r87Lc3zAonNQWpch0AS_gp0rTE-hF6E7VKMPYsmbxwHoEGo464eiCchmQ07nxhriq52Rh3EtWnPLTAATYVsXFHNZm_x6wQBQDzWw.jpg]\\n\\nAfter experiencing VEX Worlds for the first time, one of the many things that struck me, and stayed with me, was how visible the Habits of Mind were throughout the competition. From students practicing in the pits, to championship matches, and everything in between \u2013 all of the Habits were so clearly being practiced and fostered throughout the competition. When thinking about how to best describe the \u2018intangibles\u2019 and the social emotional learning that was ever present, that Habits of Mind seemed an ideal organizer for my thoughts.\u00a0\\n\\nI saw and heard each of the Habits in a number of ways, and I will try to summarize those observations here. For the purposes of this article, I\u2019m choosing one connection for each Habit, though there are many options to choose from\\n\\nHabit of Mind                                           Description of the Habit                                                                                                                                               In the Context of Competition\\nPersistence\u00a0                                            Stick to it! Persevering in a task through completion; remaining focused; looking for ways to reach your goal when stuck; not giving up.                               This is present in literally every corner and every moment of competition. From the initial robot building through the iterations of design, code, and strategy; to learning from mistakes in matches; to coming back match after match and day after day to make your robot better.\u00a0\\nListening with Understanding and Empathy                Understand others! Devoting mental energy to another person\u2019s thoughts and ideas; making an effort to perceive another\u2019s point of view and emotions.\u00a0                  When students collaborate on a team successfully, they are able to listen to teammates and attempt to understand where they are coming from. They are able to apply empathy when making decisions or working towards a compromise. They can listen to others and truly hear their ideas in order to build upon them together.\\nThinking Flexibly                                       Look at it another way! Being able to change perspectives, generate alternatives, consider options.

In identifying a problem, coming up with possible solutions, and testing those solutions, students need to be able to grow, change, and evolve their initial ideas into new iterations.\\nThinking and Communicating with Clarity and Precision   Be clear! Striving for accurate communication in both written and oral form; avoiding over- generalizations, distortions, deletions, and exaggerations.\u00a0               Teams\u2019 engineering notebooks are a visible artifact of this Habit, as they are filled with diagrams, written reflections, and precise project plans. Teams\u2019 planning conversations necessitate precise language to be sure that all team members are on the same page about what they are trying to build, or how they are trying to code or drive their robot.\\nCreating, Imagining, and Innovating                     Try a different way! Generating new and novel ideas, fluency, originality.                                                                                             When iterating on a robot design, students need to see the game elements and the robot from a new perspective, to be able to imagine things that do not yet exist. They may begin with a Herobot, but then use their experience with that robot to invent components that optimize its abilities. This takes creativity and the ability to work with constraints to make an idea come to life.\u00a0\\nThinking Interdependently                               Work together! Being able to work with and learn from others in reciprocal situations; working in teams.                                                               The most successful teams demonstrate behaviors of cooperative individuals \u2013 like \u2018listening, consensus seeking, giving up an idea to work with someone else\u2019s, empathy, compassion, group leadership, knowing how to support group efforts, altruism\u2019. Team members work together towards a common goal, while seeking to genuinely learn from and with one another.\\nThinking About Thinking (metacognition)                 Know your knowing! Being aware of your own thoughts, strategies, feelings, and actions, and their effects on others.                                                   Engineering notebooks are one of the most powerful examples of documentation of metacognition I have seen. Students document not only their robot design and competition results, but their reflections, decision making, and thought processes from the start of the season to the end. The visible learning present in an engineering notebook shows the \u2018A ha! Moments\u2019, the evolution of an idea, what students did to test it and how they made sense of their results for themselves.\\nRemaining Open to Continuous Learning                   I have so much more to learn! Having humility and pride when admitting you don\u2019t know; resisting complacency.                                                  ", "start_char_idx": 412447, "end_char_idx": 415479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69f66bb0-dc4f-440b-9b34-a505f89cb0de": {"__data__": {"id_": "69f66bb0-dc4f-440b-9b34-a505f89cb0de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a225f93-b35a-4e30-ac2e-422454ff4eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a231743c234174c789d229b16b3c6465ff47aaa996619fc60893db0e37a5bcac"}, "3": {"node_id": "74cea9c1-c96b-4e5e-93da-551b8ec2241c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6aca82a86547a9b594b8c6cde8caa1f9966328847f5e5a581cb178cd0533a093"}}, "hash": "d8317c2929d08779009de5a91a825141dbdf8527b3c88730c6046acc5eabf795", "text": "                           Teams that find an \u2018answer\u2019 to a problem or an initial strategy for the game, are motivated to continue to learn \u2013 they do not stop, they try to find a better answer or a more effective strategy! Scouting gives great visibility to this Habit, as students look outside of their team to find solutions, to learn more, and to learn from others around them.\u00a0\\nQuestioning and Posing Problems                         How do you know? Having a questioning attitude; knowing what data are needed and developing questioning strategies to produce those data; finding problems to solve.   Students are continually asking and answering questions in order to engage in iterative processes. \u201cEffective problem solvers know how to ask questions to fill in the gaps between what they know and don\u2019t know.\u201d Teams gather data and use that data to make decisions about what will be most effective on their robot design or in their code. During their interviews, they explain how and why they reached those decisions, and the questions they posed, and then answered along the way.\\nStriving for Accuracy                                   Check it again! Always doing your best; setting high standards; checking and finding ways to improve constantly.                                                       This Habit is especially present in the coding component of competitions. An autonomous project needs a lot of attention to accuracy, from where the robot is placed, to the measurements or sensor data that is used. And that project must be repeatable, and is continually optimized to make it better, so that they can score more points from match to match.\u00a0\\nTaking Responsible Risks                                Venture out! Being adventuresome; living on the edge of your competence; trying new things constantly.                                                                 The initial stages of robot design and game strategy are all about responsible risks! Teams have to try something in order to see how it works and get a baseline for iteration. From the first ideas that teams have for how to approach a new game, each idea that is offered, actioned, and tested is essentially an exercise in taking responsible risks and learning from the results in order to improve.\\nApplying Past Knowledge to New Situations               Use what you learn! Accessing prior knowledge; transferring knowledge beyond the situation in which it was learned.                                                    Not only can teams apply their learning about coding and robotics from year to year, but also their knowledge of what it means to be a good teammate. No matter the game, collaboration and teamwork never go out of style! Veteran team members can mentor rookie members, within and among teams, helping everyone to learn what collaborative strategies can help them be most successful in competition.\\nManaging Impulsivity                                    Take your time! Thinking before acting; remaining calm, thoughtful, and deliberate.

Teams need to be thoughtful in their approach, so they can make a plan together, and follow through on ideas to see them to fruition. Rather than jumping from robot building to coding to engineering notebook and back again, students take on roles on their team so that they can manage a piece of the puzzle in a deliberate way.\\nResponding with Wonderment and Awe                      Have fun figuring it out! Finding the world awesome and mysterious; being intrigued with phenomena and beauty.                                                         There is no question that this is present in competition! Students watch other teams approaches to the game, and are intrigued and visibly awed by robot design and strategy approaches. They are continually having fun in every corner of a competition - from decorating the pits to practicing to connecting with other teams from other schools, or even other countries. Not to mention the game reveal for the new season!\u00a0\\nGathering Data with All Your Senses                     Use your natural pathways! Paying attention to the world around you; gathering data through taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight.                                   Thinking about this Habit in connection to experiential learning and engaged observation brings it to robotics in a meaningful way. To me, this Habit connects to being fully \u2018present\u2019 in what you are doing and learning \u2013 similar to being in a state of \u2018flow\u2019. Walking through the pits and seeing students working on a build iteration, or working through their code, the engagement in their work is incredible.\\nFinding Humor                                           Laugh a little! Finding the whimsical, incongruous, and unexpected; being able to laugh at yourself.                                                                   As hard as teams are working, the celebrations, decorations, costumes, swag, and the sheer joy that is present during competition speaks to this Habit. Keeping humor present in what you are doing helps maintain some perspective, which can be so important. And one of the goals of robotics competitions is ultimately to make learning fun!\u00a0\\n\\nKids shaking hands [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-22%20at%202.37.01%20PM.png]\\n\\nAs much as students are learning about things like drivetrain design, using sensor data to build an algorithm, or how to document their work in an engineering notebook, they are also learning about how to engage with the people and world around them in meaningful ways. Very few, if any, students are going to get a job designing robots that lift mobile goals, or stack cubes. Yet all will have futures that require them to listen to others, to work together, to challenge themselves, to learn more, to not take themselves too seriously, to persevere, to communicate clearly and effectively, to demonstrate empathy, and to", "start_char_idx": 418579, "end_char_idx": 421696, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97868282-a097-49e6-8d8c-316fac733917": {"__data__": {"id_": "97868282-a097-49e6-8d8c-316fac733917", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59563b99-c355-4ddc-ba5d-c4a9ba1ea2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d231d112f706a4a685ca3522a96e8dea4967223093c468648cf8315bca1ba6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "74cea9c1-c96b-4e5e-93da-551b8ec2241c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6aca82a86547a9b594b8c6cde8caa1f9966328847f5e5a581cb178cd0533a093"}, "3": {"node_id": "59c24253-047a-482f-a9a2-2f470bf3ec2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cef840b022c4a64716cb8412e4e143dd7b06af6ebb0407f380a16aa24950a986"}}, "hash": "d102c0f20e9eb41fbf4a6323352751f7ba9395c06d12ec18896abdfccbe02fd5", "text": "persevere, to communicate clearly and effectively, to demonstrate empathy, and to find joy in the midst of everything else going on in their lives.

VEXcode VR educational offerings afford several levels of facilitation and scaffolding. They can be implemented individually or in combination to best match your teaching style and the needs and interests of your students. VR Computer Science Courses The Computer Science Level 1 Blocks Course, and the Computer Science Level 1 Python Course are introductory computer science courses taught using engaging, robotics-based activities in VEXcode VR. As students solve various coding challenges using the VR Robot, they learn about fundamental computer science concepts such as project flow, loops, conditions and algorithms.  VR Activities      VEXcode VR Activities are simple, student-facing, one-page student engagements that can be completed independently by students. They offer an engaging coding challenge with scaffolded levels of exploration. They can be used as a quick lesson, in a learning center, or as a supplement to the Computer Science Level 1 Blocks or Python courses. There are a variety of activities that address computer science concepts as well as cross-curricular connections, making them ideal for a variety of classroom implementations.    VR Activity Labs      A VEXcode VR Activity Lab is offers a sequence of related VEXcode VR Activities. They are student facing and designed for students to complete independently, and offer support and scaffolding for students as they complete the Lab. Activity Labs can be used for a more extended engagement with\u00a0 particular VR Playgrounds, and are flexible in that they can be adapted for a whole-class engagement if desired, or in any way that meets your students' needs.    VR Camps      VEX Camps come in two forms:\u00a0 traditional educator-facilitated camps and online camps. Thematic educator-facilitated camps are organized in 1, 3, and 5 day implementations around a variety of themes. Online camps are video-based camps led by VEX Experts, and can be implemented anywhere, anytime. Both kinds of camps can be used all year around, from summer enrichment or fall fundraisers to winter break offerings or spring family fun days, as well as in the classroom. \u00a0   Where Do I Start? If you are beginning to teach computer science with VEXcode VR for the first time, it is easy to get your program up and running. \u00a0      Visit teachvr.vex.com to find a walkthrough of essential VEXcode VR Curricular and support resources, including a welcome video, Scope and Sequences, project sharing information and where to find solutions for VR Activities and course challenges.   \n1, Testing a VEXcode V5 Competition Template Project, Once you have created your project in the Competition Template, you can test the project on your robot using these steps. This is a great way to practice your autonomous routine or driver control strategy. Need to create your project in the Competition Template? See these articles to learn more:  Using the Blocks Competition Template in VEXcode V5 Using the Python Competition Template in VEXcode V5        Begin by downloading your project to your V5 Brain. Ensure that your Controller is paired with the Brain and turned on.        Next, place the robot at its starting position on the field. On the Controller, select the right arrow to move the screen to the \u201cPrograms\u201d option.        Open the \u201cPrograms\u201d option by selecting the A button.        Select your Competition Template project by selecting the A button.        Use the right arrow to move the screen to the \u201cTimed Run\u201d option.        This will open the Start Match screen.

If you want your class to work through STEM Labs or Activities together at a relatively uniform pace, it is important to think ahead about how you will engage those students who finish building earlier than others. This article provides several suggestions for meaningful learning activities they can complete as the rest of the group finishes building.\u00a0 Have Early Finishers Help Other Students One way early finishers can put their skills to good use and learn while doing so, is by providing building help to students who need it. It's important to work together with your class to establish guidelines for student helpers, so they are able to provide assistance that helps their classmates to learn without stepping in too much and doing the building for them. Have a class discussion about what giving and receiving help from peers should look like and sound like, and create the guidelines together. Here are some suggestions for the kinds of guidelines that you could establish with your class. Helpers  Help only those who ask for help. Help students in the order on the sign-up sheet. Ask questions to be sure what kind of help is needed. Provide suggestions for solving building problems, but do not touch the robot/build.  Students who need help  Ask a helper for help first, before asking the teacher. Be patient and wait your turn. Be specific about the building problem you need assistance with.\u00a0 Try the suggestions provided by the helpers, and ask more questions if needed. Do not expect helpers to do the building for you!  Creating a protocol for classroom helpers ahead of time will ensure that both the helpers and those who are being helped are challenged and engaged. Helpers will need to think carefully about how to communicate effectively, and those who are being helped will still need to use the information provided to engage in the productive struggle required when solving problems. Additionally, creating a sign-up sheet to establish in what order students will be helped can help prevent disagreements about whose turn it is. Once you have established your classroom helping protocols, have students role play the helping procedure to practice it before they actually begin building in your classroom. This will go a long way towards helping students to employ the procedure successfully. Have Students Complete Choice Board Activities      The Choice Board in VEX GO STEM Labs offers students the opportunity to display voice and choice in their learning. The activities in the Choice Board can be used throughout the Unit, and are great options for students to explore if they are finished building before others.\u00a0   Have Students Complete VEX GO Activities      There are a number of GO Activities students can do independently using pieces remaining in the GO Kit after a build is completed. Students can be directed to choose from a list of these Activities, or can be assigned specific Activities depending on current learning goals. All of the activities shown here can be done with limited Kit contents.  Copycat! Creature Creation Map Challenge Music Beat Pin Out Tallest Tower Challenge VEX GO Fidget VEX Pin Game Writing Instructions         Additionally, you can assign students an GO Activity that gives them an opportunity to test their build. For example, if your students have built the Code Base, they can do the Create a Course Activity. Students can also practice driving their robots using the Drive tab in VEXcode GO to complete the course.        If students are new to using VEX GO, or need extra practice with the spatial reasoning involved in building and working with GO, the Discovery Activities are a great option. These ten Activities are all designed to be completed quickly and using a limited number of pieces from the Kit. To learn more about using Discovery Activities with students, see this article.

Assign students a VEXcode VR Activity that is appropriate for their level of experience for them to complete independently or in pairs. For more information about VEXcode VR, see this group of articles.\u00a0 Create a List of Additional Building Extension Activities Students Can Always Do Another strategy for engaging students who are finished is to create a list of activities students can refer to and choose from when they are finished building. Engaging students in the creation of this list will make the list more relevant to your students and in your particular setting. Some ideas you may want to include in your are:  Add the license plate to your build with your group's name on it. Organize your GO Kit or help others organize theirs. Write a list of tips and tricks for completing a build successfully. Sketch and label an idea for adding a feature to your build.  This list can be dynamic, as you and your students can add to it whenever a new idea arises.\n3, Selecting a Starting Configuration in VIQRC Pitching In for VEXcode VR, To begin your VEXcode VR Pitching In Match, you can choose the starting position of Fling, the Hero Bot, with the starting configuration window.

It is a valuable resource for anyone using the Kit to kickstart their pneumatic projects. This guide offers the necessary information to get your system operating smoothly. For guidance on coding your IQ Pneumatics Kit, view this article from the VEX Library. For examples of a basic IQ Pneumatics System operation, view this article from the VEX Library. Kit Exploration The IQ Pneumatics Kit can be broken down into 5 different functional categories. These categories include the following and are listed in order of importance from the initial pressurization of air and ending with the actuation of mechanical parts:   Air Stowage: This pertains to the components responsible for storing and distributing the pressurized air within the system, like the Air Pump and the Air Tank.  Fittings: This category includes the various types of fittings such as the Tee Fitting and Straight Fitting that connect and route the Tubing throughout the system.  Tubing: This includes the tubes that transport the pressurized air throughout the system.  Electronic Control: This category includes components like the Pneumatic Solenoid that control the operation of the pneumatic system electronically.  Cylinders: These dual-action cylinders (2x Pitch Stroke and 4x Pitch Stroke Pneumatic Cylinders) create mechanical movement through the use of compressed air.      Product   Description     Air Stowage      Air Tank 70mL       The Air Tank acts as a backup system for your pneumatics, storing extra air. When multiple parts of your pneumatic system (the cylinders) all demand air simultaneously, the Air Tank steps in. It reduces the", "start_char_idx": 8473, "end_char_idx": 12700, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdb7095d-69c6-4305-ac62-a528a3f0534f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdb7095d-69c6-4305-ac62-a528a3f0534f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f1a811d-1280-4fb5-97eb-16b0278381d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b89a6d162a26d2acb061c6a180a0b2d9159d3feeb9693b5c1761133da3e91a2"}, "3": {"node_id": "792b28a9-91f1-4522-9d7a-9e5625d6e102", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "049123ac892f2a038dec69c23183ea4326c46aa92d72817973211c146f44ac58"}}, "hash": "1c3680da81810d57055153c1067a224edab2a78c04baca58a0fd4f1b5a390945", "text": "cylinders) all demand air simultaneously, the Air Tank steps in. It reduces the system's total reliance on the Pneumatic Pump. It's a crucial component in maintaining a consistent and dependable operation of your pneumatic system.      Air Pump       The Air Pump, which you can recognize by its gray rectangular shape, works like an engine by compressing air and mainly sends it to the Cylinders through the Solenoid.  The Cylinders can't produce any force on their own, so they need the Air Pump's help. The Air Pump also sends some of the compressed air to the Air Tank. By doing this, it keeps your entire pneumatic system running smoothly and efficiently, especially when the demand is high.     Fittings      Tee Fitting       The Tee Fitting, which is easy to recognize because it looks just like the letter 'T', helps send air from one place to two different spots in your pneumatic system. This gives you the power to send air to different places at the same time, like helping multiple cylinders work together or managing more complicated routes. Using the Tee Fitting, you can come up with really creative and flexible designs for your pneumatic system. \u00a0        Straight Fi          The Straight Fitting allows you to connect two pieces of Tube together, and is also an anchor for your Tubing, making sure your pneumatic system stays put and doesn't move when running. By attaching the Tubing firmly to your structure, the Straight Fitting helps control and keep the flow of pressurized air steady. The Straight Fitting is as simple to use as pressing the Tubing into it and guiding it where it needs to go. It makes building your system easier and more reliable. \u00a0      Tubing      4mm Tubing       The 4mm diameter Tubing in your IQ Pneumatic Kit is very important. It works like veins, moving pressurized air from one part to another.  You can cut the tubing to any length you need with scissors, so it's perfect for any project. The tubing links different parts of your pneumatic system and helps it work smoothly. By adjusting the length of the tubing, you can make the best use of space in your robot's design.      Electronic Control     Pneumatic Solenoid       The Pneumatic Solenoid is an important control part, working like an electronic valve. It receives instructions from your Robot Brain and turns them into pneumatic actions by directing compressed air to the cylinders. It can control up to two cylinders at the same time, directing air to make each cylinder extend (push) or retract (pull). This part is key in managing how your pneumatic system works. \u00a0      Cylinders      2 Pitch Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder        The IQ Pneumatic Kit comes with two types of Pneumatic Cylinders: the 2x Pitch and 4x Pitch. These cylinders use air pressure to extend or retract, creating a push or pull motion.  'Pitch' refers to how far the cylinder can extend, not its starting size. They connect to the Tubing through built-in fittings and use the power of pressurized air to create linear\u00a0 movement. Select either the 2 or 4 Pitch Cylinder for your design based on how far you need it to move.      4 Pitch Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder         For examples of a basic IQ Pneumatics System operation, view this article from the VEX Library. \n5, Understanding the Pathways to VEX Certifications, In today's education landscape, keeping up-to-date with relevant teaching tools and strategies is key.

It is a valuable resource for anyone using the kit to kickstart their pneumatic projects. This guide offers the necessary information to get your system operating smoothly. For guidance on coding your V5 Pneumatics Kit, view this article from the VEX Library. Kit Exploration The V5 Pneumatics Kit can be broken down into 7 different functional categories. These categories include the following and are listed in order of importance from the initial pressurization of air and ending with the actuation of mechanical parts:   Reservoir: this includes components related to the influx and storage of compressed air in the system.  Pressure Monitor: this includes devices used to regulate and monitor the air pressure in the system.  Fittings: this category is for various types of connectors and plugs used to join tubes together or to connect them to different parts of the system.  Tubing: this category is for components related to the flexible tubes that carry the air in a pneumatic system.  Manual Control: this category contains devices that allow for manual control of the airflow in the system.  Electronic Control: this category is for components that provide electronic control over the system.  Cylinders: this is where the mechanical work happens in a pneumatic system. Cylinders use the energy of the compressed air to create motion.     Product Description    Reservoir     Air Tank    The Air Tank is a cylindrical vessel for storing pressurized air. It has two ports which can accept different fittings. One port would contain the Value Stem which serves as the inlet. The other port will be used as an outlet and can accept one of the other fittings listed below. The Air Tank can be attached to your robot or project using zip ties. Remember, just like you'd need to recharge a battery when it's running low, you need to refill the Air Tank when it's low on air. And, just like turning off a machine when you're done using it, you should also let the air out of the tank after you're done.     Valve Stem    The Valve Stem is a small gold colored part that looks like the pressure inlet on a bike or car tire (formally called a Schrader Valve). It's important for getting your pneumatic system ready to go. You can screw it securely into the Air Tank or the Straight Female Fitting using its M5 thread.

This is a one-way valve that lets air in, but not out, meaning as soon as you remove your pump from the valve, it closes to keep the air in. You can release the air from your Air Tank by pushing the pin in the center of the Valve Stem.     Pressure Monitor      Air Pressure Regulator     The Air Pressure Regulator in your system is like a control knob for the air pressure. Adjusting the air pressure allows the Cylinders to operate at a constant force as the pressure in the Air Tank decreases. For example, if the Air Tank is initially pressurized to 100psi, the pressure in the tank reduces with each actuation of a Cylinder. Without a pressure regulator, the force of the Cylinder will not be consistent - it will reduce as the pressure in the Air Tank reduces. If you set the regulator to 50psi for example, the force of the cylinder will be consistent for all actuations until the Air Tank pressure drops below 50psi. So by regulating the pressure, the Cylinders will operate with less force, but with more consistency. You will also get more actuations from the Cylinders before the air runs out. You can connect parts called fittings to the regulator's inlet (where the air comes in denoted by an embossed triangle) and outlet (where the air goes out). Then, you can change the pressure of the air that's leaving by turning the black dial. This makes sure that the pressure doesn't go above a certain limit.     Air Pressure Regulator Bracket    The Air Pressure Regulator Bracket is used to mount the Air Pressure Regulator to your robot. Remove the black nut near the knob of the Air Pressure Regulator and slide the bracket on. Then replace the nut and tighten to hold the Air Pressure Regulator to the Bracket. The Bracket can be attached to your robot using standard VEX hardware.     Air Pressure Gauge    The Air Pressure Gauge in your system is like a meter that tells you how much pressure is in the Air Tank, or system depending where it is mounted. It's usually put before the Regulator and helps you see the total pressure. The Gauge has an M5 thread, so you can connect it to the Straight Female Fitting or straight into any M5 hole, like one on the Air Tank.      Fittings     Straight Male Fitting    The Straight Male Fitting is used when you need to connect Tubing to an Air Tank, Air Pressure Regulator, Solenoid or Cylinder. Screw the M5 thread into the device that you need to connect to the Tubing. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing.     Elbow Fitting    The Elbow Fitting is similar to the Straight Male Fitting, but the Tubing exits at a 90-degree angle. The M5 thread can be screwed into the device that you need to connect the Tubing to. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing. The Elbow Fitting also has a mounting hole which can be used for securing it to your robot.     Air Flow Valve Fitting    The Air Flow Valve Fitting is used to control the speed at which your Air Cylinders move. Unlike the Air Pressure Regulator which controls the force of the Air Cylinder movement, the Air Flow Value controls the flow rate which affects speed. The Air Flow Value is usually fitted to a port on the Air Cylinder for which you want to control the speed.     Tee Fitting    The Tee Fitting, which is named for its \"T\" shape, lets you connect 3 pieces of Tubing together in your pneumatic system. For example, you might use it to connect the Air Tank, Air Pressure Gauge and use the third outlet to supply air to the rest of the system. The Tubing is a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing.

The Tee Fitting has two mounting holes which can be used for securing it to your robot.     Straight Female Fitting    The Straight Female Fitting is used when you need to connect a male M5 thread to a piece of Tubing. For example, the Air Pressure Gauge can be connected using this part. The male M5 thread of the device can be screwed to the female thread of this fitting. The Tubing is then a push-fit into the red end of the fitting. To release the Tubing from the fitting, press the red release button and remove the Tubing.     4mm Plug    The 4mm Plug, which has a solid black tube on one side and a small handle on the other side, is a useful tool for closing off open ends in your pneumatic system. It fits tightly into any Pneumatic Fitting that isn't being used and is the same size as your tubing. This is useful for parts like the Solenoid where unused outputs could let air escape. Instead of having to reroute extra tubing with a Tee Fitting, you can put this plug straight into a Fitting to stop the airflow. This makes sure all the pressurized air stays in your system, providing a way to save space and use your system efficiently.    Tubing    Tubing Cutter    The Tubing Cutter, an important part of your pneumatic toolkit, is used to cut your Tubing to just the right lengths. Its triangular blade makes clean, straight cuts, which helps prevent air from leaking out. To use it, you put your Tubing in the cutter and squeeze it to make a neat cut. Don't forget to be careful with the cutter because the blade is sharp. This tool helps make your system work as well as possible.     4mm Tubing    The 4mm Outer Diameter x 2.5mm Inner Diameter Polyurethane (PU) Tubing in your Pneumatic Kit works like the veins in your pneumatic system, moving pressurized air from one part to another. Just like how veins carry blood in our bodies, this tubing moves air around in your setup. Tubing can be cut to any length using the Tubing Cutter.     Manual Control     Shut Off Valve Fitting     The Shut Off Valve Fitting has a tap which can be used to turn the air flow on and off. The Shut Off Valve Fitting is marked with an arrow which denotes the direction of airflow. Be sure to connect the Value to your system so that the air flows in the correct direction. You can control the flow of air by turning the top dial: when it's turned so it's making a \"T\" with the flow, the valve is closed, and when it's turned so it's in line with the flow, it's open. Closing the valve prevents air from flowing to the rest of the system which can prevent air loss when not in use and allow you to ensure the system is safe.      Electronic Control     Double Acting Solenoid    The Double Acting Solenoid is controlled by your V5 Brain. You can code your robot to direct air to one of the two outlets on the Solenoid, which are typically used to either extend or retract a Pneumatic Cylinder. You can connect either the Straight Male Fitting or Elbow Fitting to the ports on the Solenoid which then allow you to connect Tubing to carry air to the rest of the system. There are two ports marked P, one on each side of the Solenoid. This is where the pressurized air supply is connected. You can use the other P port to connect the pressurized air to other parts of your system. The pressurized air can be directed to either port A or port B and is controlled by your code. There are two exhaust ports labeled R where the waste air exits when the Air Cylinder is moving. These ports are a through hole, meaning both are joined together. For more information on the uses and applications of the Double Acting Solenoid, view this article from the VEX Library.     Double Acting Solenoid Driver Cable    The Double Acting Solenoid Driver Cable links the Double Acting Solenoid to the V5 Brain of your robot.

Cylinders     25mm Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder    The Pneumatic Cylinder, which comes in three sizes in the Kit, turns pressurized air into a back-and-forth motion and can extend (push) and retract (pull) because it has a dual-acting feature. The \"stroke length,\" or how far the cylinder moves in one cycle, is different for each size, so it can fit different project needs. You connect the Cylinder to the Tubing using a Straight Male, Elbow Pneumatic Fitting, or Air Flow Valve Fitting. This makes a setup that turns air pressure into movement. Remember, the more pressure you supply to the cylinder, the stronger the force it exerts - so more pressure means more force.      50mm Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder      75mm Stroke Pneumatic Cylinder      For examples of a basic V5 Pneumatic System operation, view this article from the VEX Library. \n8, Using the VEX V5 Leaderboard, The VEX V5 Leaderboard is a fun and interactive tool that can be used to display and document student performance in the STEM Labs, keeping students engaged with each other.

Topics in this article will cover the purpose of building Striker and the next steps to make it your own.      Hero Bots are designed by VEX engineers each year to play the Competition. The Hero Bot design changes from year to year depending on the game, so the Hero Bot for the VRC game Over Under is Striker.Remember, the Hero Bot is designed as a starting point for you to test and improve upon, not an end product. The Hero Bot is designed so that new teams can learn valuable building skills and have a robot they can customize to compete with early in the season. Advanced teams can also use the Hero Bot to be able to quickly assemble a robot to investigate the game's dynamics.        The 2023-2024 Hero Bot is in no way a final product however, a Triball scoring machine. To reiterate, the Hero Bot is a starting point. We here at VEX believe that everyone should have a fair chance at competing in this year\u2019s Competition, thus the Hero Bot is born.Competing can seem intimidating, especially when there are teams who have been competing for many years with a lot of experience.Building Striker, one is able to understand more about the game and what is actually needed in a robot design, rather than just reading it on a piece of paper.        Perusing the Over Under Game Manual, it is hard to exactly envision a robot that performs scoring activities while at the same time obeying rules as a newcomer.This is exactly why Striker has been made and offered to everyone, for the purpose of allowing everyone to start in the same place regardless of experience.   Beginning Robot Design Think about it this way; there is almost an infinite combination of the parts and connection patterns provided in your VEX V5 Competition Starter Kits (link to poster). With that statement being true, mathematically, anything is possible. You just have to find that exact formula to answer all your problems. The question that arises with that is this, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d Starting Line Believe it or not, once you have built Striker and tested the game, you have already started! When beginning to freely-build, it is definitely worth your while to state why and for what purpose you are freely-building. The questions to these answers have most likely been found through your testing of Striker. It is often helpful to document your thinking and design constraints found in the game manual before you begin to build.       You could make a chart with the goals you want your design to achieve.  Some examples of goals you may want to achieve include:  I want the design to score a Triball. I want the design to be Elevated at the end of the match. I want the design to traverse the Long Barrier.              You could also make a chart with the constraints on your design.  Some examples of constraints you", "start_char_idx": 36540, "end_char_idx": 40489, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eda4fbf4-745d-42c8-b079-066746e9a8a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "eda4fbf4-745d-42c8-b079-066746e9a8a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d727db04-9403-4d28-b295-a39d83481758", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "64bc131550661b6b3305a64c02575cdf13f0aa144ab056815740e5f317ebb686"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f280225-1687-4d91-b49c-593af7800e0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b637751302fa5aeb94a24c458cf124522756e59ebdd3f24ac571ad070110c61"}}, "hash": "fa4697dea8095c853cc4efa27ede48a34591b3252640071083de8801b8d8a094", "text": "a chart with the constraints on your design.  Some examples of constraints you may have to consider include:  Only can use 88W of combined power of all motors (11W &amp; 5.5W). Only can use V5 System parts. Only can store one Triball at a time.        It is important to lay these questions out not only for the sake of remembering them, but also to stay on track. With infinite combinations of connections, it can be hard to remember exactly why you started once you have started. Listing your goal and all the limiting factors can help to ensure you create what you originally wanted. Design, Create, and Iterate Knowing your goal and constraints sets the stage for designing your solution. Before building, it is important to have a plan. Build Instructions offer a very specific and detailed plan for a build. When free building, plans can be looser, but should involve some kind of sketch of what it is that you are trying to build. This means practice creating a mental model of your idea, transferring that to paper, then matching your drawing to actual pieces from the Kit.  Once you have laid out what you want to achieve with your build and the factors directly in between you and that goal, it is then a balancing act. You must find the perfect balance between your constraints and your goals to create what exactly you set out to achieve. Do not be afraid to try new things! It is important as you experiment with these possible solutions and builds that you do not follow one specific path. With an almost infinite combination of parts in the Kit, there is definitely more than one approach to your problem! Test and iterate on your build to make sure it achieves your goal and still meets your constraints. The entire free building process is loads of fun as it places you in the driver\u2019s seat! Lastly, while this is a competition, it is a friendly competition to say the least.  Visit the VEX Forum and VEX Professional Development Plus (PD+), which has a lot of great resources from other team\u2019s builds!

With that statement being true, mathematically, anything is possible. You just have to find that exact formula to answer all your problems. The question that arises with that is this, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d Starting Line Believe it or not, once you have built Byte and tested the game, you have already started! When beginning to freely-build, it is definitely worth your while to state why and for what purpose you are freely-building. The questions to these answers have most likely been found through your testing of Byte. It is often helpful to document your thinking and design constraints found in the game manual before you begin to build.       You could make a chart with the goals you want your design to achieve.  Some examples of goals you may want to achieve include:  I want the design to be able to intake Red Blocks and score them. I want the design to remove Blocks from the Supply Zone. I want the design to be very mobile.              You could also make a chart with the constraints on your design.  Some examples of constraints you may have to consider include:  Only can use less than or equal to 6 IQ Smart Motors. Fit within an 11\u201d wide x 20\u201d long x 15\u201d high (279mm x 483mm x 381mm) volume. Only be built from the VEX IQ product line.        It is important to lay these questions out, not only for the sake of remembering them, but also to stay on track. With infinite combinations of connections, it can be hard to remember exactly why you started once you have started. Listing your goal and all the limiting factors can help to ensure you create what you originally wanted. Design, Create, and Iterate Knowing your goal and constraints sets the stage for designing your solution. Before building, it is important to have a plan. Build Instructions offer a very specific and detailed plan for a build. When free building, plans can be looser, but should involve some kind of sketch of what it is that you are trying to build. This means practice creating a mental model of your idea, transferring that to paper, then matching your drawing to actual pieces from the Kit.  Once you have laid out what you want to achieve with your build and the factors directly in between you and that goal, it is then a balancing act. You must find the perfect balance between your constraints and your goals to create what exactly you set out to achieve. Do not be afraid to try new things! It is important as you experiment with these possible solutions and builds that you do not follow one specific path. With an almost infinite combination of parts in the Kit, there is definitely more than one approach to your problem! Test and iterate on your build to make sure it achieves your goal and still meets your constraints. The entire free building process is loads of fun as it places you in the driver\u2019s seat! Lastly, while this is a competition, it is a friendly competition to say the least.  Visit the VEX Forum and VEX Professional Development Plus (PD+), which has a lot of great resources from other team\u2019s builds! Get inspiration, ask questions, or view solutions to questions you may have that have already been answered by either VEX employees, VEX mentors, or VEX enthusiasts!\n11, Driving Byte, the 2023-24 VIQRC Hero Bot, To get started driving with the 2023-24 VIQRC Hero Bot, Byte, you will need to use a provided code for use with the Controller.

If VEXcode V5 is closed or a new project is loaded, the sounds will not operate. However, upon reloading the original project file, the custom sounds will resume playing as anticipated.  \n15, Teaching with the VRC Spin Up Activity Lab, The VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) Spin Up Playground in VEXcode VR and the accompanying VRC Activity Lab, can be used as part of your curriculum. This Activity Lab walks you through coding the robot to remove discs from dispensers and then score the discs.   Overview of the VRC Spin Up Activity Lab VEXcode VR Activity Labs are sequenced Activities with some additional scaffolding and supports added to help students as they complete the Lab. The Activities are all designed to be student-facing so they can be used to extend student engagement with VEXcode VR Playgrounds, like VRC Virtual Skills - Spin Up. Activity Labs are designed to be flexible, so that students can engage with them as is, or activities can be extended or adapted to best meet your students needs and your teaching style      Each Activity in the Lab includes an overview of what the robot should accomplish, a bulleted list to help break down the task into smaller components, and helpful hints if students need assistance while coding.   There are 12 Activities that make up the VRC Spin Up Activity Lab. All of these Activities are listed below, including what concepts are covered, and the number of each activity.\u00a0      In\u00a0Take It and Leave It (1) and\u00a0Intake and Score High (2), students will code the intake discs from the field and score them in both the low and high goals. They will learn how to use the Intake motor in order to accomplish each of the tasks.        In Roll It Red\u00a0(3), students are challenged to drive to a roller on the field then use the Optical Sensor to spin the roller until it is red. They will learn how to use the Intake motor group with the rollers and how to use the Optical Sensor in a VEXcode project.        In Where to Start (4), students will explore the different starting locations available and then put together all of their skills from the previous activities to intake and score two discs.        In GPS Guidance (5) and Load It and Launch It (6), students will use sensors to collect discs and score them in the high goal. GPS Guidance has students use the GPS Sensor on Disco, the Hero Robot, and Load It and Launch It has students use the Bottom Distance Sensor to detect when a disc has been moved onto the field through the loaders.\u00a0        In Score a Pile of Discs (7) and Three Discs, One Launch (8) students will continue to use sensors to gather and score discs. In Score a Pile of Discs, students are introduced the Line Trackers placed throughout the intake to detect how many discs have been gathered by the robot. In the Three Discs, One Launch Activity, students will use the Bottom Distance sensor to drive the Hero Bot to the three Discs highlighted in green, pick up the three Discs, and score them in the blue High Goal.\u00a0        In Be Efficient! (9), students are challenged to take what they have learned about coding the different sensors on Disco, the Hero Robot, and apply them to score six discs as fast as possible.

This Activity Lab walks you through coding the robot to remove discs from dispensers and then score the discs.   Overview of the VIQC Slapshot Activity Lab VEXcode VR Activity Labs are sequenced Activities with some additional scaffolding and supports added to help students as they complete the Lab. The Activities are all designed to be student-facing so they can be used to extend student engagement with VEXcode VR Playgrounds, like VIQC Virtual Skills - Slapshot. Activity Labs are designed to be flexible, so that students can engage with them as is, or activities can be extended or adapted to best meet your students needs and your teaching style.      Each Activity in the Lab includes an overview of what the robot should accomplish, a bulleted list to help break down the task into smaller components, and helpful hints if students need assistance while coding.   There are 10 Activities that make up the VIQC Slapshot Activity Lab. All of these Activities are listed below, including what concepts are covered, and the number of each activity.\u00a0      In\u00a0Knock the Dispensers (1) and\u00a0Spin the Dispensers (2), students will code the robot to remove discs from all three types of dispenser (blue, yellow, and purple). They will learn how to use the Intake and Arm motors in order to accomplish each of the tasks.        In Take It and Score It (3), students will build on their code to pick up one of the discs released from a dispenser using the Intake, then score the disc. This furthers their understanding of the Intake motor to get a higher score in Slapshot.        In Where to Start (4) and Time It! (5), students will explore the different starting locations available and then put together all of their skills from the previous activities to clear discs from three dispensers in the fastest time possible.\u00a0        In Explore Locations (6) and Follow the Shortest Route (7), students will create a coordinate system for the VIQC Slapshot Playground and use the coordinates to perform calculations to move from one location", "start_char_idx": 63803, "end_char_idx": 67436, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ce09c90-0607-4317-ba7e-11e4c9366bdc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ce09c90-0607-4317-ba7e-11e4c9366bdc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f467d47-2039-4a7a-9f2e-2bbd94f481ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3c3fe84d79878de310acf2aa60b6f7bbe3ae2a31bd6d45a095382a16688810"}, "3": {"node_id": "bde41288-334f-4490-9781-877e6d68952b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8c5cbaaea7d32fdda525b76a610e07065d64f33a714517ff6d59be64df8475e"}}, "hash": "b0e4c9a657977b0468e6094ade98f21fab5458c963a9dd5ef0701f563145a7c9", "text": "Playground and use the coordinates to perform calculations to move from one location to another using the shortest possible route.

How the GPS Sensor Works in VRC Over Under in VEXcode VR      The GPS (Game Positioning System) Sensor, uses the VEX Field Code on the interior of the Field to triangulate X, Y position and heading. That checkerboard pattern in the Field Code is used to identify the location for each individual block in that pattern. The VEX GPS is an absolute position system, so it does not drift nor does it require calibration on a per-field basis. To sense the Field Code, the VEX GPS Sensor, a black and white camera, is mounted on the rear of the robot and faces rearwards. The GPS Sensor reports the (X, Y) coordinates of the center of rotation of Striker on the Field, in millimeters or inches.    Identifying (X, Y) Coordinates on the VRC Field The VRC Over Under Field in VEXcode VR ranges from approximately -1800mm to 1800mm for the X and Y positions. The starting location of Striker depends on the starting position selected. The center location, or the origin (0,0), is located in the center of the Field.

Identifying the (X, Y) Coordinates of the GPS Sensor      The GPS Sensor can be used to identify the X and Y coordinates of Striker on the Field. These coordinates reflect the location of Striker's center of rotation, which is located between the front wheels, as indicated in this image. \u00a0        Reporter blocks from the Sensing category in the Toolbox can be used to report positional values from the GPS Sensor in your project.        The current X and Y coordinates of Striker's GPS Sensor on the Field can be displayed in the Print Console using blocks from the Looks category in the Toolbox.    Using the GPS Sensor to Help Striker Navigate the Field You can use the GPS Sensor to help Striker navigate the Field by driving to specific locations using your knowledge of the Cartesian coordinate system. Using the GPS Sensor, Striker can drive along the X or Y-axes until the value of the sensor is greater than or less than a threshold value. This allows Striker to drive using sensor feedback instead of set distances.      In this project, Striker will drive forward from starting position A, until the value of the Y-axis is greater than -1000 millimeters (mm), then stop, placing Striker in position to turn and collect a Triball. Note: You may have to account for the robot\u2019s inertia or drift when setting your parameters.    GPS Sensor Location and the Center of Rotation on Striker      The GPS Sensor is mounted in the rear of the robot, whereas Striker's center of rotation is located in the front of the robot. The GPS Sensor is configured in VRC Over Under in VEXcode VR to account for this offset (approximately -150 mm on the X axis, and -295 mm on the Y axis), so that the values that are reported reflect the center of rotation of Striker.    (X, Y) Coordinates of Game Elements in VRC Over Under for VEXcode VR Knowing the coordinates of game elements, like the Triballs and scoring zones, can help you plan your projects in VRC Over Under in VEXcode VR. The following reference is provided as a guide, based on the Field setup at the start of each Match, for the approximate center point coordinate locations of the game elements on the VRC Field in the Playground. Scoring Zone Coordinates  Triball Coordinates  Post Coordinates   Identifying the GPS Heading of Striker      The GPS Sensor can also be used to identify the GPS heading. The heading ranges from 0 degrees to 359.9 degrees, following a compass heading style. When using the GPS Sensor to detect location, the GPS heading will remain constant in relation to the Field, regardless of the starting position of the robot.  \n36, Using the Pre-Match Checklist in VRC Virtual Skills, To begin your Virtual Skills Over Under Match, you must use the Pre-Match checklist to select your robot starting location, your robot starting direction, whether or not your robot has a preload, and the Field preload location.

Virtual Striker has the same dimensions and motors as the physical Striker, but with added sensors for autonomous programming in VEXcode VR. On the Over Under Playground in VEXcode VR, there is only one robot, and it is already preconfigured. This eliminates the need for a robot configuration, or a predetermined template project.   Robot Controls Striker has the following controls:                      A drivetrain. This enables the \u201cDrivetrain\u201d category of blocks in the Toolbox of VEXcode VR to drive and turn the robot.                        An Arm that is controlled by the Arm Motor. The Arm can be raised and lowered. This allows the robot to transport Triballs. The Arm can be lowered using the [Spin for] block. The Arm will be fully lowered when spun forward for 1200 degrees.        An Intake that is controlled by the Intake Motor. The Intake can be spun forward and in reverse. This allows the robot to collect and score Triballs. The Intake can be spun using the [Spin for] block. The Intake will collect a Triball when spun forward 360 degrees and score or drop a Triball when spun in reverse for 360 degrees.    Robot Sensors Virtual Striker has added sensors for autonomous programming in VEXcode VR. Inertial Sensor      The Inertial Sensor is used with the drivetrain to allow Striker to make accurate and precise turns using the drivetrain heading.        The drivetrain heading reports a value from 0 to 359.9 degrees, and clockwise is positive. For more information on the Inertial Sensor, view this article from the VEX Library.   Optical Sensor      The Optical Sensor reports if an object is close to the sensor, and if so, what color that object is. The Optical Sensor can also report the brightness and the hue value of an object in degrees.        The Optical Sensor is located under the Arm of Striker, pointing towards the Intake. It can be used to determine when a Triball is in the Intake, and also what color that Triball is. For more information about the Optical Sensor, see this VEX Library article.   Rotation Sensor      The Rotation Sensor can report rotational position, total rotations, and rotation speed.        The shaft that rotates the Arm on Striker is placed through the Rotation Sensor. This sensor can be used to measure the rotational position, total rotations, and rotation speed of the Arm as they are raised and lowered.                        The rotational position when the Arm is raised is 0 degrees (default at the start of the project). The rotational position when the Arm is fully lowered is 168 degrees. Note: These values are different from the 1200 degrees used in the [Spin for] block to fully lower the Arm. For more information about the V5 Rotation Sensor, view this article from the VEX Library   Game Positioning System (GPS) Sensor      The GPS Sensor can report the current X and Y position of the center of rotation of Striker in millimeters or inches. The GPS Sensor can also report the current heading in degrees.        The GPS Sensor is located near the back of Striker, and is used to determine the robot\u2019s position and orientation on the Field by reading the GPS Field Code Strips along the inside perimeter of the Field.        You can use the GPS Sensor to help Striker navigate the Field by driving to specific locations using your knowledge of the Cartesian coordinate system. Using the GPS Sensor, Striker can drive along the X or Y-axes until the value of the sensor is greater than or less than a threshold value. This allows Striker to drive using sensor feedback instead of set distances.

There are many resources in this article that will help you get started and begin building with your new system.  Note: Throughout this article, you will find links to other VEX Library articles and resources that will provide more detailed information about each of the subjects.  Getting organized As you start to unpack your VEX EXP Kit, the first thing that becomes obvious is \u2014 there are a lot of parts. The first steps to success are to identify the parts. You may have just one Kit, or an entire bundle. For more information on Getting Started with an EXP Classroom Bundle, view this article from the VEX Library. Identifying the Parts VEX Robotics separates its VEX EXP parts into three categories:  Electronics Structure &amp; Hardware Motion Tools &amp; Accessories  The EXP Electronics include devices such as the EXP Brain, EXP Controller, Smart Motors (5.5W), EXP Battery, sensors, and cabling. The Structure &amp; Hardware parts include things like metal C Channels, U Channels, Angles, Plates, gussets and fasteners. The Motion parts include all of the things which move, such as wheels, gears, sprockets, and other accessories. Lastly, Tools and Accessories include the tools in order to assemble, maintain, and optimize your EXP Robot! You will notice that your EXP Storage Bins do the hard work for you. Structure Components and Tools (right) are all contained within the Structure Bin, while Motion Components will be bundled together in the remaining bin alongside Electronics (left).  One way to identify all these parts is the EXP Parts Poster found at posters.vex.com.       Another method of identifying parts is to search on the part name/part number from your kit\u2019s part list and match them to the images of the parts found on the VEX website.    Powering Up After you become familiar with your kit\u2019s parts and organize your kit, the next step is to prepare your EXP Robot Brain and EXP Controller for use. This will include:  Charging the EXP Controller. Charging the EXP Battery. Connecting the EXP Robot Brain with the EXP Robot Battery.  In addition, your EXP Controller will need to be paired with the EXP Robot Brain and your EXP Robot Brain will need to have its firmware updated.  To assist you there are VEX Library articles providing details on how to accomplish each of these tasks. The articles are listed below. Charging the EXP Controller Charging your Controller is accomplished with the USB-C connection.

This is accomplished inserting the EXP Battery into the slot underneath the EXP Brain. The EXP Cable has a locking tab and can only be inserted in one orientation. The battery needs to be firmly inserted into the EXP Brain until it locks in place.   For more information about connecting the EXP Battery to the EXP Brain\u00a0refer to:  Connect - Battery for VEX EXP  Pairing the EXP Brain and EXP Controller      After the EXP Brain and the EXP Controller both have charged batteries, you will need to pair the two in order to establish communication. This is accomplished by navigating to the Link option in the EXP Brain's Settings, and quickly double pressing the EXP Controller's Power Button while simultaneously holding both of the Left Bumpers. Once a EXP Controller and a EXP Brain are successfully paired this will not need to be done again. For more information regarding pairing a EXP Controller with a EXP Brain refer to Wirelessly Pairing an EXP Controller to an EXP Brain.   Updating the Firmware Many VEX EXP products contain their own internal processors and run on a special Operating System. This software is the VEX EXP Firmware and is called VEXos. It is important to update your new equipment\u2019s firmware in order for it to function correctly.  For more information on updating your firmware refer to these articles:  Updating VEX EXP Brain Firmware in App-based VEXcode EXP Updating VEX EXP Brain Firmware in Web-based VEXcode EXP Updating VEX EXP Controller Firmware in App-based VEXcode EXP Updating VEX EXP Controller Firmware in Web-based VEXcode EXP (Mac/Chromebook) Updating VEX EXP Controller Firmware in Web-based VEXcode EXP (Windows)   Help with Instructions There are a number of options for building your first robot. Whether it will be the EXP BaseBot, one of the many builds found on the VEX Robotics site, or one of the builds found in the STEM Labs; it is recommended to start with a set of instructions in order to familiarize yourself with the VEX EXP system before assembling your first custom-designed robot.  Overview of Build Instructions  Build Instructions are either a .pdf such as the Clawbot EXP Build Instructions or 3D Build Instructions, as found with the Speed Build.  Each of these Build Instructions includes a set of helpful hints and detailed steps which will guide you throughout the build process. Helpful Hints for Using Build Instructions A crucial part of the design and the educational process is making mistakes. As you build your first robot you will be experiencing this process. Here are a few hints to help limit some of mistakes that can be made:      Inventory of parts - Be sure to collect all the correct parts prior to starting each step.        Green lines - Many of the illustrations for assembly will have green lines to indicate where parts should go.        Orientation of parts - Pay close attention to the orientation of parts within the illustrations. For example, a gear placed on the wrong side of a C channel will not work because it will not line up with the driving gear on the Smart Motor that will move the gear.        Notations for connecting cables - When connecting Smart Cables between a device and the EXP Brain the number notation indicates the Smart Port number on the EXP Brain the cable needs to be plugged into.

For a walkthrough guide to build your first EXP Robot, view this article from the VEX Library. Information on Parts The VEX EXP system has many different types of parts. Substituting the wrong part for an instruction set in most cases does not work. An understanding of the EXP parts can be very helpful.   Structural - Structural metal parts include C-channels, Flat Beams, Gussets, and Plates. The instruction sets within the Builds should require no modifications to the structural pieces.\u00a0 For more information refer to, Building with EXP Motor Groups   Fasteners - Earlier versions of the VEX Educational Robot system utilized screws with a hex socket heads for tightening. The EXP system uses star sockets on the heads of the screws. Star sockets are less prone to stripping and allows you to firmly tighten screw and nut systems. For a walkthrough guide to using EXP tools and fasteners, view this article from the VEX Library. For more information on fasteners refer to:  Overview of VEX Screws Standoff Retainers - Structure for VEX EXP    Wheels - There are many different options for wheels to use on a EXP Robot. The wheels come in several different sizes and are available in traction versions or wheels designed for omni-directional motion. For more information about wheels refer to, Understanding EXP Wheels.   Gears and sprockets - The gears and sprockets which are used on the EXP robot to transfer power from the Smart Motors are sized by their number of teeth. For more information refer to:  Overview of EXP Chains and Sprockets    Assembling Chain and Tank Treads The VEX EXP system has chains and tank treads which can be used with sprockets. These parts are assembled by connecting individual links together and this allows for custom lengths to be used between sprockets. The links can be assembled by bringing two together at a slight angle, aligning the hole on one link with the boss on the next. Then twist the two links until they snap together as a unit.          Example of assembling Chain Links.                Example of assembling Tank Treads.   To disassemble to chain/tank tread links, reverse the procedure.      One technique which may help when connecting the two ends of an assembled chain/tank tread is to lay the chain/tank tread on a sprocket while connecting the two ends.    What is Next? Once you have assembled your first robot, you can now program it! The Get Started with VEX EXP article will help you get started with programming your robot under the section of coding. The next adventure will be designing your own robot.

This article will explain the steps in a troubleshooting process, and provide tips for how to use these steps.\u00a0 The steps of this process are:  Identify the problem Check hardware Check software Analyze and apply data   Identify the Problem The first step to troubleshooting your sensor is to identify which sensor is causing the problem. Compare the observed robot behavior with the intended robot behavior. Is the problematic behavior caused by a sensor? If so, which sensor? If you need more information to determine which sensor may be the problem, read the article(s) below related to the sensors on your robot. VEX GO Sensors:  Coding with the VEX GO Eye Sensor Coding with the VEX GO LED Bumper Coding with the VEX GO Brain Coding with the VEX GO Electromagnet  Once you have identified which sensor is causing the unintended behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check", "start_char_idx": 110310, "end_char_idx": 114021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8d2844f-5302-47a7-9565-886aa5f97e1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8d2844f-5302-47a7-9565-886aa5f97e1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9edb1379-35a9-46f8-8221-6678e4137320", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "651e768f97f93475d13fa909e4dea1df808b7ba6aa25a2d1ce30b9bc5564a732"}, "3": {"node_id": "27e1f534-d951-453b-a920-e6632b61eddc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11c3a18d7fa8b92164b48352d37deaa9c52ea6639a351b8edffb0b428f4569f7"}}, "hash": "c0b8426626e08c2f6798727369c8bf26a7477e1c159a1fef6f93203e37e2dc0e", "text": "behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check the hardware on the robot to be sure that the sensor can function as intended. Each of the following hardware considerations could be affecting the functionality of your sensor. Check Sensor Placement      Begin by looking at where the sensor is located on your robot. Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like another part of your robot? Ensure that the sensor has the space needed to operate as intended. As shown here, the Eye Sensor has a clear line of vision to the object it is meant to detect.    Check Sensor Connection      Test the sensor\u2019s functionality by looking at the data reported in the VEX Classroom App. Once you have selected the VEX GO Brain you are troubleshooting, select 'Show Device Info' to view the data for sensors connected to that Brain. This can help you validate that the sensor is plugged in and working. To learn more about the device info shown in the VEX Classroom App view this article.        Once you have the Device Info displayed in the Classroom App, see if the sensor is reporting data. If not, ensure your sensors are plugged in correctly. When plugging in sensors, you should hear a snap when the sensor\u2019s locking tab is fully engaged in a port. Be sure the port that the sensor is connected to matches what is shown in the Classroom App as well. View this article to learn more about how each of the sensors connects to the GO Brain. You can also try swapping out the sensor you are using with another to see if that resolves your issue.   If you changed something with your sensor placement or sensor connection, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. If your sensor placement and connection did not change, move onto the next step to continue the troubleshooting process.  Check Software Once you have identified that the sensor is placed on and connected to the robot successfully, you can look to the VEXcode GO project next. Iterating on a project can help you to ensure that the data from the sensor is being used effectively in your project. The following strategies can help you with coding your sensor. If you apply any of these strategies to your VEXcode GO project, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue.\u00a0 Check Firmware and Configuration      Begin by ensuring that your GO Brain\u2019s firmware is up to date. The Brain will automatically update when connected to VEXcode GO, as shown in this image.        You can also check and update your GO Brain\u2019s firmware using the VEX Classroom App. View this article to learn more about updating the GO Brain firmware with the VEX Classroom App.        Now that you are sure all devices are correctly connected to the Brain, check the Device Configuration in VEXcode GO. View the articles in this section to learn more about configuring your robot in VEXcode GO. Check to be sure all of the sensors are present in the configuration. Then, check to be sure each one is connected to the correct port. Change any incorrect device configurations.   Run an Example Project      Open an Example Project that uses the sensor you are troubleshooting. Select 'File' then 'Open Examples' to view the Example Projects in VEXcode GO.        Open an Example Project that uses the sensor you are troubleshooting. You can select the \u2018Sensing\u2019 category to filter example projects.        Once open, read the Note to determine if the functionality in the example project aligns with what you are trying to do with the sensor. In the example project shown here, the note indicates that the Eye Sensor is being used to detect an object so that the robot can stop driving and turn when an obstacle is detected. Run the example project and observe the robot behavior. Then look at the project to see how the sensor data is being used in order to cause the observed behaviors. You may want to run the example project multiple times to help with this. You may also want to try to create your own simplified project to apply what you have learned from the example project to your task.

Monitoring and Printing Data You can also view data from the sensor as the example project or your project is running, to help you better understand what the sensor is reporting in real time. This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project.\u00a0      Viewing sensor data in the Monitor Console is helpful when you want to see the values changing as a VEXcode GO project is running. This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project. Blocks in the Sensing category of the Toolbox can be added to the Monitor Console by selecting the checkbox beside the block, as shown in this image. View this article to learn more about viewing sensor values in the Monitor Console in VEXcode GO.        Printing to the Print Console in VEXcode GO be used to display information as a project is running, to help provide visual cues to help see what is happening in a VEXcode GO project at a\u00a0specific\u00a0moment in a project. This can help make the visual connection between the project and the actions of the VEX GO Robot easier to see. In the image shown here, data about the robot's heading at various times while the project is run is being printed. Blocks from the 'Looks' category of the Toolbox are used to print to the Print Console in VEXcode GO. \u00a0 View this article for more information about using the Print Console in VEXcode GO.    Analyze and Apply Data Next, use what you have learned in the previous steps to adjust your original project. You can continue to use tools like the Help and monitoring or printing data to enable you to use the sensor effectively to accomplish your goal. You can also ask questions about your project to help you move forward. Think about things like:   Is your whole stack attached to the {When started} hat block? Blocks will only run when they are connected. You can listen for a click sound when you drag blocks and connect them together.  Did you try stepping through your project?\u00a0Use the 'Step' button to run your project one block at a time. This can slow down the project execution to make it easier to see where your project is having a problem, or where issues with the project flow might be. View this article to learn more about how to step through a VEXcode GO project.   Is your project getting stuck? Are your conditions set correctly? If you are using nested loops, try simplifying your project to isolate individual behaviors.  Are your parameters correct? Are you using the data from the sensor to set your parameters? Did you choose the dropdown option that you need?  Are your environmental conditions influencing the sensor? Is it too bright or too dark? Are there objects or people in the way?

Check the VEXcode VR Project Once you have identified which sensor is causing the issue, and where it is located on the VR Robot,\u00a0 you can move on to checking your VEXcode VR project. Iterating on a project can help you to ensure that the data from the sensor is being used effectively in your project. The following strategies can help you with coding your sensor. Run an Example Project      Open an example project that uses the sensor you are troubleshooting. You can select the \u2018Sensing\u2019 category to filter example projects. For more information about using example Blocks projects in VEXcode VR, see this article. For more information about using example Python projects in VEXcode VR, see this article.        Once open, read the Note to determine if the functionality in the example project aligns with what you are trying to do with the sensor. In the example project shown here, the note indicates that this example project provides an example of how all the available Distance Sensor commands can be used with the robot. Run the example project and observe the robot behavior. Then look at the project to see how the sensor data is being used in order to cause the observed behaviors. You may want to run the example project multiple times to help with this. You may also want to try to create your own simplified project to apply what you have learned from the example project to your task.   Use the Help Use the Help feature in VEXcode VR for the blocks or commands in the example project, or in your project, to learn about the data that is used, what values the command will report, and examples of how to use the command in a project.

Read Data on the Monitor Console Monitoring sensor values in the Monitor Console in VEXcode VR allows the user to view real-time reports of a specific sensor value (or multiple values) in a project.      To open the Monitor Window and view the Monitor Console, select the Monitor icon next to the Help.                        Blocks from the Sensing category in the tool box can be added and removed from the Monitor Console by selecting and deselecting the corresponding check box.        Selected sensor values will be displayed in the Monitor Console, and can be used to adjust your VEXcode project as needed in order to get the desired behavior from the VR robot. For additional information about monitoring sensor values in VEXcode VR, see this article. To monitor sensor values in VEXcode VR Python, the\u00a0monitor_sensors command needs to be added to the project. For more information about monitoring sensors in VEXcode VR with Python, see this article.   Step Through Your Project The Step button in VEXcode VR Blocks allows you to see the Blocks in your project being executed on at a time. This can be helpful in trying to determine which sensing block is causing the issue in your project.      The step button is located in the upper right corner of the screen, beside the Start button.\u00a0 For more information about Stepping Through a VEXcode VR Project, see this article.   Analyze and Apply Data Next, use what you have learned in the previous steps to adjust your original project. You can continue to use tools like the Help and printing data to enable you to use the sensor effectively to accomplish your goal. You can also ask questions about your project to help you move forward. Think about things like:   Are you using greater than &lt; or less than &gt; in your project? Is the symbol facing the right direction? If you are using equal to = try replacing it with a greater than or less than, to use a range of values.  Are your parameters correct? Are you using the data from the sensor to set your parameters? Did you choose the dropdown option that you need?  Are you checking the conditions more than once? Try adding a Forever loop to your project, so that the condition is checked repeatedly when the project is run.  Is your project getting stuck? Are your conditions set correctly? If you are using nested loops, try simplifying your project to isolate individual behaviors.  Are you detecting the correct color? Is the sensor reporting a different color than the one you have in your project? Try changing the color parameter in the block or command.  Are you detecting an object within the sensor\u2019s field of view? Remember that the field of view moves in conjunction with the movement of the robot.  Are you using a waiting block while checking a condition? Be sure to use non-waiting blocks in a project when checking for a condition.  If you are coding in blocks, is your whole stack attached to the {When started} hat block? Blocks will only run when they are connected. You can listen for a click sound when you drag blocks and connect them together.  Are you running your project in the correct Playground? The correct playground must be selected in order for your project to work as intended.\u00a0  As you answer these questions, be sure to change one thing in your project at a time, test it, then evaluate whether that change was effective. Testing your project frequently can help you to more easily see how your code is connected to the robot\u2019s behaviors.\u00a0 You may need to repeat steps in the troubleshooting process multiple times to solve your problem, and that is ok.

Compare the observed robot behavior with the intended robot behavior. Is the problematic behavior caused by a sensor? If you need more information to determine if a sensor may be the problem, read the article(s) below related to the sensors on your robot. VEX 123 Sensors:  Coding the 123 Eye Sensor using the Coder\u00a0 Coding the 123 Eye Sensor with VEXcode 123 Identifying the 123 Robot's Features  Once you have identified which sensor is causing the unintended behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check the hardware on the robot to be sure that the sensor can function as intended. Each of the following hardware considerations could be affecting the functionality of your sensor. Check that the sensor is not blocked      Begin by looking at where the sensor is located on your robot. Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like the Art Ring? Ensure that the sensor has the space needed to operate as intended. As shown here, the Eye Sensor has a clear line of vision to the object it is meant to detect.    Check Sensor Connection\u00a0      Test the sensor\u2019s functionality by looking at the data reported in the VEX Classroom App. Once you have selected the 123 Robot you are troubleshooting, select 'Show Device Info' to view the data for sensors connected to that Brain. This can help you validate that the sensor is working. To learn more about the device info shown in the VEX Classroom App view this article. You can also try swapping out the 123 Robot you are using with another to see if that resolves your issue.   If you changed something to unblock the sensor or adjust a Coder card, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. If your 123 Robot or Coder cards did not change, move onto the next step to continue the troubleshooting process.  Check Software Once you have identified that the sensor is not blocked and is reporting data successfully, you can look to your Coder or VEXcode 123 project next. Iterating on a project can help you to ensure that the data from the sensor is being used effectively in your project. The following strategies can help you with coding your sensor. If you apply any of these strategies to your project, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue.\u00a0 Check Firmware      Begin by ensuring that your 123 Robot\u2019s firmware is up to date. The robot will automatically update when connected to VEXcode 123, as shown in this image.        If you are using the Coder, be sure both the robot and Coder firmware are up to date. You can check and update both your 123 Robot and Coder firmware using the VEX Classroom App. (The Coder firmware can only be updated with the Classroom App.) View this article to learn more about updating the 123 Robot with the VEX Classroom App. View this article to learn more about updating the Coder with the VEX Classroom App.   Check Coder cards      You can check that the Coder cards are being read accurately, and are not damaged.

This article will explain the steps in a troubleshooting process, and provide tips for how to use these steps.\u00a0 The steps of this process are:  Identify the problem Check hardware Check software Analyze and apply data   Identify the Problem The first step to troubleshooting your sensor is to identify which sensor is causing the problem. Compare the observed robot behavior with the intended robot behavior. Is the problematic behavior caused by a sensor? If so, which sensor? If you need more information to determine which sensor may be the problem, read the article(s) below related to the sensors on your robot. VEX EXP Sensors:  Understanding Inertial Sensor Data from the VEX EXP Brain Using Bumper Switch with VEX EXP Using Distance Sensor with VEX EXP Using Optical Sensor with VEX EXP  Once you have identified which sensor is causing the unintended behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check the hardware on the robot to be sure that the sensor can function as intended. Each of the following hardware considerations could be affecting the functionality of your sensor. Check Sensor Placement      Begin by looking at where the sensor is located on your robot. Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like another part of your robot?", "start_char_idx": 142710, "end_char_idx": 146942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaf0704f-cbaf-4bfa-a584-1b337389bae5": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaf0704f-cbaf-4bfa-a584-1b337389bae5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e970d15a-e57a-433e-b469-7d307dac0e61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "35f5dd7c04747848b994266e5f2b8584e53e2cb84a91a8125ae24af40f6ef821"}, "3": {"node_id": "961b2bb9-b0d1-4a0e-a0b3-f0a5e46b880f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9910a2901fee8ecc57c84383a911b19ace891075c002d067a406023d5d891cc6"}}, "hash": "b0753ef28f086ab5d86dac9354ac4e9a7b304a37cf2e65c394994a63f0d9ff2f", "text": "Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like another part of your robot? Ensure that the sensor has the space needed to operate as intended. As shown here, the Optical Sensor has a clear line of vision to the object it is meant to detect.   Check Sensor Connection      Test the sensor\u2019s functionality by looking at the data reported in the Devices Screen on the VEX EXP Brain. This can help you validate that the sensor is plugged in and working.\u00a0 To access the Devices Screen, follow the steps in this article.\u00a0Once the Devices Screen is open, see if the sensor is reporting data.        If the sensor is not reporting data, ensure your sensors are plugged in correctly. When plugging in sensors to a Smart Port, you should hear a snap when the sensor\u2019s locking tab is fully engaged in a port. When plugging sensors into a 3-Wire Port, the cable should be fully inserted in the correct orientation with the white wire closest to the Brain screen.\u00a0 You can also try swapping out the sensor you are using with another to see if that resolves your issue.   If you changed something with your sensor placement or sensor connection, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. If your sensor placement and connection did not change, move onto the next step to continue the troubleshooting process.  Check Software Once you have identified that the sensor is placed on and connected to the robot successfully, you can look to the VEXcode EXP project next. Iterating on a project can help you to ensure that the data from the sensor is being used effectively in your project. The following strategies can help you with coding your sensor. If you apply any of these strategies to your VEXcode EXP project, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. Check Firmware and Configuration      Begin by ensuring that your EXP Brain\u2019s firmware is up to date. See this article to learn more about updating firmware on the EXP Brain in App-based VEXcode EXP. See this article to learn more about updating firmware on the EXP Brain in Web-based VEXcode EXP.        Now that you are sure all devices are correctly connected to the Brain, check the Device Configuration in VEXcode EXP. Check to be sure all of the sensors are present in the configuration. Then, check to be sure each one is connected to the correct port. Change any incorrect device configurations.   Run an Example Project      Open an Example Project that uses the sensor you are troubleshooting. You can select the \u2018Sensing\u2019 category to filter example projects. For more information about EXP Blocks Example Projects and Templates, see this article. For more information about EXP Python Example Projects and Templates, see this article. For more information about EXP C++ Example Projects and Templates, see this article.        Once open, read the Note to determine if the functionality in the example project aligns with what you are trying to do with the sensor. In the example project shown here, the note indicates that the Bumper Switch is being used to detect when the switch is pressed so the robot can stop driving when it comes into contact with an object. Run the example project and observe the robot behavior. Then look at the project to see how the sensor data is being used in order to cause the observed behaviors. You may want to run the example project multiple times to help with this. You may want to try to create your own simplified project to apply what you have learned from the example project to your task.   Use Other VEXcode EXP Tools There are also tools and strategies that you can use to help you as you learn more about coding your sensor in VEXcode EXP. You can learn about the blocks or commands in the Toolbox individually by using the Help. You can also view sensor data as a project is running to learn more about what the sensor is reporting.      The Help Read the Help for the blocks or commands in the example project, or in your project to learn about the data that is used, what values the command will report, and examples of how to use the command in a project.

Printing Data You can also print data from the sensor as the example project or your project is running, to help you better understand what the sensor is reporting in real time. This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project.\u00a0 Note that in a Blocks project, a separate {When started} hat block can be used to keep all of the printing commands organized in their own stack.   VEXcode EXP Blocks    VEXcode EXP Python    VEXcode EXP C++    Select each image above to enlarge. Printing to the EXP Brain is helpful when you want to see the values changing as a VEXcode EXP project is running. This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project. These print commands can be built into the VEXcode EXP project you have already created so you can see the sensor values change at specific times while the robot is moving.\u00a0 These example projects above show how to print values from the Inertial Sensor to the EXP Brain. The comments in each project explain the flow of the project and use of each command.     VEXcode EXP Blocks\u00a0    VEXcode EXP Python    VEXcode EXP C++    Select each image above to enlarge. Printing to the Print Console in VEXcode EXP is recommended for when you are running a VEXcode EXP project where the robot does NOT move. The EXP Brain must remain plugged in during the execution of the project in order to print to the Print Console. This is beneficial because you can read the values from the VEXcode EXP window rather than trying to read data from the Brain screen. These examples show a project printing data from the Distance Sensor to the Console in VEXcode EXP.\u00a0 For more information about using the Print Console in VEXcode EXP Blocks, see this article. For more information about using the Print Console in VEXcode EXP Python, see this article.    Analyze and Apply Data Next, use what you have learned in the previous steps to adjust your original project. You can continue to use tools like the Help and printing data to enable you to use the sensor effectively to accomplish your goal. You can also ask questions about your project to help you move forward. Think about things like:   Are you using greater than &lt; or less than &gt; in your project? Is the symbol facing the right direction? If you are using equal to = try replacing it with a greater than or less than, to use a range of values.  Are your parameters correct? Are you using the data from the sensor to set your parameters? Did you choose the dropdown option that you need?  Are you checking the conditions more than once? Try adding a Forever loop to your project, so that the condition is checked repeatedly when the project is run.  Is your project getting stuck? Are your conditions set correctly? If you are using nested loops, try simplifying your project to isolate individual behaviors.  Are your environmental conditions influencing the sensor? Is it too bright or too dark? Are there objects or people in the way? Try running your project in a different location to see if that helps.  Are you running the most recent version of your project? Have you downloaded your updated project to the Brain? Make sure you redownload the project each time you make a change.  Are you detecting the correct color? Is the sensor reporting a different color than the one you have in your project? Try changing the color parameter, or using a range of hue values, to see if that helps.

This article will explain the steps in a troubleshooting process, and provide tips for how to use these steps.\u00a0 The steps of this process are:  Identify the problem Check hardware Check software Analyze and apply data   Identify the Problem The first step to troubleshooting your sensor is to identify which sensor is causing the problem. Compare the observed robot behavior with the intended robot behavior. Is the problematic behavior caused by a sensor? If so, which sensor? If you need more information to determine which sensor may be the problem, read the article(s) below related to the sensors on your robot. VEX IQ (2nd gen) Sensors:  Understanding Inertial Sensor Data from the VEX IQ (2nd gen) Brain Using the IQ Distance Sensor (2nd gen) Using the IQ Optical Sensor Using the VEX IQ Bumper Switch Using the VEX IQ Touch LED  Once you have identified which sensor is causing the unintended behavior, you can move forward in the process.  Check Hardware The second step is to check the hardware on the robot to be sure that the sensor can function as intended. Each of the following hardware considerations could be affecting the functionality of your sensor. Check Sensor Placement      Begin by looking at where the sensor is located on your robot. Is the sensor being blocked by anything, like another part of your robot? Ensure that the sensor has the space needed to operate as intended. As shown here, the Optical Sensor has a clear line of vision to the object it is meant to detect.   Check Sensor Connection      Test the sensor\u2019s functionality by looking at the data reported in the Devices Screen on the VEX IQ (2nd gen) Brain. This can help you validate that the sensor is plugged in and working. To access the Devices Screen, follow the steps in this article.        Once the Devices Screen is open, see if the sensor is reporting data. If not, ensure your sensors are plugged in correctly. When plugging in sensors, you should hear a snap when the sensor\u2019s locking tab is fully engaged in a port. You can also try swapping out the sensor you are using with another to see if that resolves your issue.

If you changed something with your sensor placement or sensor connection, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. If your sensor placement and connection did not change, move onto the next step to continue the troubleshooting process.  Check Software Once you have identified that the sensor is placed on and connected to the robot successfully, you can look to the VEXcode IQ project next. Iterating on a project can help you to ensure that the data from the sensor is being used effectively in your project. The following strategies can help you with coding your sensor. If you apply any of these strategies to your VEXcode IQ project, test your project again to see if this resolved the issue. Check Firmware and Configuration      Begin by ensuring that your IQ Brain\u2019s firmware is up to date. See this article to learn more about updating firmware on the IQ (2nd gen) Brain in App-based VEXcode IQ. See this article to learn more about updating firmware on the IQ (2nd gen) Brain in Web-based VEXcode IQ.        Now that you are sure all devices are correctly connected to the Brain, check the Device Configuration in VEXcode IQ. Check to be sure all of the sensors are present in the configuration. Then, check to be sure each one is connected to the correct port. Change any incorrect device configurations.   Run an Example Project      Open an Example Project that uses the sensor you are troubleshooting. You can select the \u2018Sensing\u2019 category to filter example projects. For more information about IQ Blocks Example Projects and Templates, see this article. For more information about IQ Python Example Projects and Templates, see this article. For more information about IQ C++ Example Projects and Templates, see this article.        Once open, read the Note to determine if the functionality in the example project aligns with what you are trying to do with the sensor. In the example project shown here, the note indicates that the Distance Sensor is being used to detect an object so that the robot can stop driving once the object is reached. Run the example project and observe the robot behavior. Then look at the project to see how the sensor data is being used in order to cause the observed behaviors. You may want to run the example project multiple times to help with this. You may want to try to create your own simplified project to apply what you have learned from the example project to your task.   Use Other VEXcode IQ Tools There are also tools and strategies that you can use to help you as you learn more about coding your sensor in VEXcode IQ. You can learn about the blocks or commands in the Toolbox individually by using the Help. You can also view sensor data as a project is running to learn more about what the sensor is reporting.      The Help Read the Help for the blocks or commands in the example project, or in your project to learn about the data that is used, what values the command will report, and examples of how to use the command in a project. View this article to learn more about accessing Help in VEXcode IQ Blocks. View this article to learn more about accessing Help in VEXcode IQ Python. View this article to learn more about accessing Help in VEXcode IQ C++.   Printing Data You can also print data from the sensor as the example project or your project is running, to help you better understand what the sensor is reporting in real time. This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project.\u00a0 Note that in a Blocks project, a separate {When started} hat block can be used to keep all of the printing commands organized in their own stack.

This can help you determine what reported values from the sensor to use as parameters in your project. These print commands can be built into the VEXcode IQ project you have already created so you can see the sensor values change at specific times while the robot is moving.\u00a0 These example projects above show how to print values from the Inertial Sensor to the IQ Brain.

The IQ Brain must remain plugged in during the execution of the project in order to print to the Print Console. This is beneficial because you can read the values from the VEXcode IQ window rather than trying to read data from the Brain screen. These examples show a project printing data from the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) to the Console in VEXcode IQ.\u00a0 For more information about using the Print Console in VEXcode IQ Blocks, see this article. For more information about using the Print Console in VEXcode IQ Python, see this article.      Analyze and Apply Data Next, use what you have learned in the previous steps to adjust your original project. You can continue to use tools like the Help and printing data to enable you to use the sensor effectively to accomplish your goal. You can also ask questions about your project to help you move forward. Think about things like:   Are you using greater than &lt; or less than &gt; in your project? Is the symbol facing the right direction? If you are using equal to = try replacing it with a greater than or less than, to use a range of values.  Are your parameters correct? Are you using the data from the sensor to set your parameters? Did you choose the dropdown option that you need?  Are you checking the conditions more than once? Try adding a Forever loop to your project, so that the condition is checked repeatedly when the project is run.  Is your project getting stuck? Are your conditions set correctly? If you are using nested loops, try simplifying your project to isolate individual behaviors.  Are your environmental conditions influencing the sensor? Is it too bright or too dark? Are there objects or people in the way? Try running your project in a different location to see if that helps.  Are you running the most recent version of your project? Have you downloaded your updated project to the Brain? Make sure you redownload the project each time you make a change.  Are you detecting the correct color? Is the sensor reporting a different color than the one you have in your project? Try changing the color parameter, or using a range of hue values, to see if that helps.  Are you detecting an object within the sensor\u2019s field of view? Remember that the field of view moves in conjunction with the movement of the robot.  Are you using a waiting block while checking a condition? Be sure to use non-waiting blocks in a project when checking for a condition.

Analyze and Apply Data Next, use what you have learned in the previous steps to adjust your original project. You can continue to use tools like the Help and printing data to enable you to use the sensor effectively to accomplish your goal. You can also ask questions about your project to help you move forward. Think about things like:   Are you using greater than &lt; or less than &gt; in your project? Is the symbol facing the right direction? If you are using equal to = try replacing it with a greater than or less than, to use a range of values.  Are your parameters correct? Are you using the data from the sensor to set your parameters? Did you choose the dropdown option that you need?  Are you checking the conditions more than once? Try adding a Forever loop to your project, so that the condition is checked repeatedly when the project is run.  Is your project getting stuck? Are your conditions set correctly? If you are using nested loops, try simplifying your project to isolate individual behaviors.  Are your environmental conditions influencing the sensor? Is it too bright or too dark? Are there objects or people in the way? Try running your project in a different location to see if that helps.  Are you running the most recent version of your project? Have you downloaded your updated project to the Brain? Make sure you redownload the project each time you make a change.  Are you detecting the correct color? Is the sensor reporting a different color than the one you have in your project? Try changing the color parameter, or using a range of hue values, to see if that helps.  Are you detecting an object within the sensor\u2019s field of view? Remember that the field of view moves in conjunction with the movement of the robot.  Are you using a waiting block while checking a condition? Be sure to use non-waiting blocks in a project when checking for a condition. View this article to learn more about waiting vs. non-waiting blocks in VEXcode V5.   If you are coding in blocks, is your whole stack attached to the {When started} hat block? Blocks will only run when they are connected. You can listen for a click sound when you drag blocks and connect them together.  As you answer these questions, be sure to change one thing in your project at a time, test it, then evaluate whether that change was effective. Testing your project frequently can help you to more easily see how your code is connected to the robot\u2019s behaviors.\u00a0 You may need to repeat steps in the troubleshooting process multiple times to solve your problem, and that is ok. Each iteration will help you learn more about the sensor you are using and how to code it in VEXcode V5.\n57, Building VEX IQ Claws, Claws are usually attached to an end of an arm and are used for grasping an object. Motors are used to activate the claws. Motors are commonly used with a gear ratio or sprocket/chain system.\u00a0 Single-sided and double-sided claws may use an increase torque gear ratio and roller claws may use an increase speed gear ratio. Claws can be assembled using a variety of Beams, Gears, and the Other Products from the VEX IQ System. Rubber bands, Intake Flaps, and/or Traction Links can be used to increase the grip on claws.\u00a0 If time is available, several prototypes of claws should be developed during the design stage to assess which will be most effective for manipulating game pieces. Sometimes a simple claw design can be the most competitive.\u00a0 Some common types of claws are explained in this article. Please note that 3D build examples of these common types types of claws are included. The models can be manipulated, turned, and zoomed in and out in order to see multiple viewpoints.\u00a0  Single-sided Claw Single-sided claw or sometimes called a clamping claw is typically assembled with a fixed beam and a second beam attached to a motor/gear system.  The side of the claw activated by the motor opens, and closes, clamping the game piece against the fixed beam.  To understand how the Single-sided Claw functions and how it is built, please refer to the resources below.

The Animation provides a demonstration of its working, while the 3D Build offers a detailed look at its construction.            Double-sided Claw Double-sided claw (as seen on the Clawbot) will activate both sides of the claw.  Custom assembled double-sided claws typically have an even number of gears setup to move the two sides of the claw. One side of the claw will be attached to the first gear in the assembly and the second side of the claw will be attached to the last gear in the assembly, allowing the claw to open and close as the gears are rotated.  To understand how the Double-sided Claw functions and how it is built, please refer to the resources below. The Animation provides a demonstration of its working, while the 3D Build offers a detailed look at its construction.          Roller Claws Roller claws are typically assembled using Wheels, Intake Belts, or Tank Treads. Roller claws function by spinning their rollers and having game pieces pulled into the claw. Then the rollers can be reversed, pushing them out.  Roller claws can be assembled with one side of the claw having a fixed beam serving as a friction plate. The other side will have an active roller to roll the game piece in, along the fixed side. A roller claw can also be assembled with a roller on both sides of the claw. Typically roller claws are designed to spin faster than the robot can move forward. Roller claws allow game pieces to be picked up with less time aligning the robot, however, they require more time and planning to assemble.  To understand how the Roller Claw functions and how it is built, please refer to the resources below. The Animation provides a demonstration of its working, while the 3D Build offers a detailed look at its construction.        \n58, Custom Controller Code in VEXcode IQ, Using the Controller can make it easier to drive and move your robot to complete a task. However, there are limitations to using the Drive program, and depending on your robot build or the task at hand, you may want different controls. Coding the Controller allows you to optimize the Controller to make it fit your robot and the task at hand better. There are several ways to code the Controller in VEXcode IQ. Each has its advantages and limitations, and some methods are better suited for certain situations depending on the desired outcome. This article will walk you through three different options for custom coding the Controller in VEXcode IQ. Each method will be described with its advantages, limitations, and an example use case to help guide you when choosing a method. For the purposes of this article, all code examples shown were created for the Clawbot. However, the same concepts could be applied to numerous other builds found on builds.vex.com, and custom builds. Option 1: Assigning Buttons in the Device Configuration This option is great when you are using a standard build, like a BaseBot or Clawbot, and want to get up and running quickly. This option lets you assign motors, a drivetrain, or motor groups to buttons on the Controller in the Device Configuration. For more information about how to assign buttons to the Controller in the Device Configuration, view this article.  Summary of Option 1: Assigning Buttons in the Device Configuration     Advantages   Limitations   Example Situation      Quick setup with no coding needed Simplest method Easily adjustable Can assign individual motors, a standard drivetrain, and motor groups to buttons     Button assignments are limited to the number of buttons on the Controller Drivetrain cannot exceed 4 motors or be customized (only a standard drive is supported, not an H drive, holonomic, or other custom drivetrain)     Manipulating a standard build such as a BaseBot, Clawbot, or a simple modification of those standard builds. For example, a BaseBot with an intake attached to the front controlled by a motor group. Manipulating which buttons correspond to different behaviors on the robot quickly without much coding       Option 2: Using a Forever Loop If you are using a custom build instead of a standard build, or want to be able to have more customization in your Controller, this option is a good one.

Using a Forever loop is a great introduction to create custom code for your Controller. This option places all of the conditions for the Controller, and its associated buttons, in a Forever loop. This provides more flexibility, especially with custom build designs, but also requires some coding experience. One consideration when using this option however, is the length and complexity of your project. The more conditions that are added, the longer the code stack may become. This means that multiple blocks have to be executed in order, and when there are a lot of blocks, this can slow down project execution. Slower project execution may create a lag between pressing Controller buttons and seeing the robot behavior. The specific example shown below is one way that you can use a Forever loop with a custom design robot (such as a robot with a custom drivetrain) to drive the robot and manipulate the claw and arm in order to interact with objects.

Explanation of Option 2 Code.     Code Piece   Explanation      A Clawbot was used for this code example. When the buttons on the Controller are used to raise and lower the arm, as soon as the button is released, due to gravity the arm will fall back down. Setting both the arm and claw to \u201chold\u201d will ensure that both the arm and claw will remain in place even after the buttons on the Controller have been released.           A Clawbot was used for this code example. When the buttons on the Controller are used to raise and lower the arm, as soon as the button is released, due to gravity the arm will fall back down. Setting both the arm and claw to \u201chold\u201d will ensure that both the arm and claw will remain in place even after the buttons on the Controller have been released. A Forever loop is used in order to continuously check for which buttons are being pressed on the Controller. The [Set motor velocity] blocks are used to set the motor velocity to the current Controller\u2019s position along the A and D axes. This is the equivalent to setting a car in drive. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make the car move, it just sets it. Each joystick axis returns a value between -100 to +100, and returns a value of zero when centered. This then means that the joystick axes, when pushed, equate to -100% to 100%. The farther towards 100 or -100 the axes are pushed, the faster the motor will spin. The [Spin] block is then used to actually move the motor. This is the equivalent to pressing the gas on the car once the direction has been set. This allows each motor to be controlled by one of the four Controller axes.        A Clawbot was used for this code example. When the buttons on the Controller are used to raise and lower the arm, as soon as the button is released, due to gravity the arm will fall back down. Setting both the arm and claw to \u201chold\u201d will ensure that both the arm and claw will remain in place even after the buttons on the Controller have been released. The [If then else if then else] block is used to map certain behaviors to buttons being pressed or released on the Controller. In this section of code, the conditions set are if the E Up or E Down buttons are pressed. If so, certain behaviors will happen, such as the arm raising and lowering. There is also the else portion of the condition, if neither button is pressed, the arm is set to stop moving. Note the following section of code in the project for the Claw follows the same explanation.     Summary of Option 2: Using a Forever Loop     Advantages   Limitations   Example Situation      Can accommodate custom builds, especially drivetrains with more than 4 motors Can assign multiple behaviors to a single button Can assign behaviors to different axes on the Controller (as opposed to the only options of Left Arcade, Right Arcade, Split Arcade, and Tank Drive in the Device Configuration)     Requires some amount of", "start_char_idx": 192744, "end_char_idx": 196889, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf1e5aa0-d8cd-4a8a-bab2-8f21c19f8172": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf1e5aa0-d8cd-4a8a-bab2-8f21c19f8172", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "da66d736-926e-4ed0-8ab8-9411c0091a0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "97fa802f13d64f3bba1ac650606d71d6d959fca343832cc671001a7333c53746"}, "3": {"node_id": "05e26194-4ad2-4a4f-bff8-ad558774d758", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e0fd665d38c30d4643718c118c93a60858ddfebe24418611564d53bf2f7ef64"}}, "hash": "7aec4ed46103d8f78e7cebe9a073a2766259daf7a42ba4b770044e9d05485909", "text": "Split Arcade, and Tank Drive in the Device Configuration)     Requires some amount of coding knowledge (conditionals, loops, and knowledge of the buttons/joysticks on the Controller) Potential for slower project execution, or lag in button response time. Since all commands are contained within a single Forever loop, the code execution could run slowly depending on the conditions set and the length of the code.     Using the Controller with a custom built robot, especially with a non-standard drivetrain When wanting to assign multiple behaviors to a single button. For example, when the F Up Button is pressed, the Claw can open, drive forward, and then close around an object.       Option 3: Using Events If you want a lot of customization to your Controller, Using Events is the best option for you. One button press can trigger multiple robot behaviors, like pressing a button to open the claw, raise the arm, and drive forward for a set distance. Trying to code multiple behaviors per button within a Forever loop would cause the project execution to slow dramatically \u2013 using Events allows you to do this more effectively. This option uses Events to break up the project flow. This is similar to using a Forever loop, but allows for the code to be more organized, so that the button execution has a faster response time. Faster response time means you will not see a lag between pressing Controller buttons and seeing the robot behavior. This example shows the same behaviors as the previous project, but done using the Events instead of the Forever Loop.

Before editing your VEXcode V5 project, check that you have the correct gear cartridge selected in the device configuration. The default choice is the green 18:1 gear cartridge. For more information about configuring individual motors in VEXcode V5, view this article.        Check the commands used in your project. [Spin to position] is used to spin a motor to a specific position. In contrast, the [Set position to] block sets the motor encoder\u2019s position to the given value and will not move the motor. Ensure that you are using [Spin to position] rather than [Set position to] in your projects.        Make sure that you know the correct degree position that you want the motor to move to. Any gear trains could impact the number of degrees needed to fully raise an arm or open a claw. See this article to learn more about gear ratios with VEX V5 Smart Motors.        If you are unsure of how far to move a motor, use the device information available on the V5 Brain screen. To open the device information for a motor, first select 'Devices' from the V5 Brain screen.        Then select the motor that you want to see more information for. NOTE: The motor must be plugged into the V5 Brain in order to be seen on the devices screen.        Once opened, you will be able to see the degree and rotational position of the V5 Smart Motor selected. This will update in real time if you want to see how the values change as the motor spins. The device information reports the position of the motor in degrees and revolutions, so as you move a motor (like opening and closing a claw) the numbers will change. Use this testing to determine how many degrees or rotations are needed to close a claw, raise an arm, spin an intake, etc.    Problem: VEXcode Project Getting Stuck Your project may seem to get stuck because the motor cannot reach its intended target position.

Problem: Motors Not Holding a Position  You may have an arm motor that moved down unexpectedly because it is being pulled by gravity or other forces. Using [Set motor stopping] allows you to control that movement of the arm after another command is completed.      The [Set stopping to] command allows you to determine the behavior of the motor after it stops spinning. Using the \u2018hold\u2019 parameter will instruct the motor to fight gravity. \u2018Hold\u2019 causes the motor to come to an immediate stop and will return it to the stopped position if moved.        Set the motors to \u2018hold\u2019 before other commands using the motors as shown in this custom Controller code example here.  \n60, Overview of VEX IQ (2nd gen) Sensors, Sensors provide the ability for a robot to receive feedback from the environment.

Historically this transition from blocks to text-based programming can feel to students like learning an entirely new language, where they cannot apply the logic they had previously learned using blocks.1 VEXcode VR Switch was developed in order to facilitate that transition from block-based to text-based programming. This article will cover how to use VEXcode VR Switch and walk you through a classroom scenario to explain and illustrate those features in context.  Using Switch Blocks Switch incorporates familiar elements of block-based programming and integrates text-boxes where text commands can be typed. This allows the students to slowly transition to text as they learn the commands and syntax that goes along with Python.                               Switch provides students a natural bridge from Blocks into text-based coding. As students gain familiarity with the logic and sequencing of commands, they can begin to convert a project one block at a time.\u00a0   This allows students to continue working with the logic flow of a block-based program where they can physically see things like the wrapping of a loop around other blocks while also beginning to experiment with text commands themselves. Once the blocks are converted to Switch, students can easily change parameters and begin to understand the syntax", "start_char_idx": 212886, "end_char_idx": 216866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "945110df-80c8-487e-8ade-0213c4c1b79e": {"__data__": {"id_": "945110df-80c8-487e-8ade-0213c4c1b79e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "73882093-c0e2-4e10-9116-c54a22de9993", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "55451818fc4f64f1065c32a61d3218f37e26b50db01f47b403e5cb007bca4405"}, "3": {"node_id": "3dd63d09-e03d-4495-8420-2d089bbd731b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "009079f15d780641fe82de17b82e29735c63a001e3cd118ab6c16b0b35b1a1ae"}}, "hash": "5184aaa030aeb6f402159b444d821cad776720b2d2067035e5b1ed53dba4bae4", "text": "to Switch, students can easily change parameters and begin to understand the syntax of the text command.

Learn more about VEXcode VR subscriptions here. Once you have your license, learn how to access Switch using the information in this article. Switch in the Classroom Austin is a student who has been coding with blocks for several years. While some students in the class are still new coders, Austin wants to learn more about Python and how to move into coding the VR robot using text. Ms. Hunter, the Computer Science teacher, noticed that Austin was ready for an additional challenge and introduced Switch to help scaffold Austin's learning and introduce text-based coding. Ms. Hunter demonstrated some of the basics like converting a block and opening the Help to learn more about the Switch Python command for each of the blocks.\u00a0 Today Ms. Hunter assigned the Coral Reef Cleanup activity to the class. She uses VEXcode VR for her coding classes because she knows that she can differentiate her instruction and reach students of varying coding levels with the same activities. Switch mode helps to facilitate that differentiation for students like Austin. In the Coral Reef Cleanup activity, the goal is to collect as much trash as possible before the battery runs out on the VR Robot. Understanding the challenge and how to code basic algorithms, Austin creates a VEXcode VR project that uses the Down Eye Sensor to detect the border of the Playground and drive in reverse to avoid harming the coral.  Converting a Single Block to Switch Convert 1 block                      Now that Austin has a project he has tested and verified works, the next step is to convert a block to Switch in order to begin exploring Python.\u00a0  Blocks can be converted to Switch by long pressing or right clicking on the block, then selecting the \u2018Convert to Switch Block\u2019 option, as shown in the video here.   Austin can now see that the [Drive for] block turned into the drive_for Python command. After converting, Austin runs the project to ensure it still works as intended. After the conversion, Austin wants to learn more about the drive_for command. By opening the Help of the [Drive for] block, Austin can make connections between the parameters from the block to the Python command. Using the Help to learn more about Switch Python Commands Open Help                      In order to look at the Switch Python Command information in the Help, Austin opens the Help window and selects the [Drive for] block, then scrolls to the bottom as shown in the video here.\u00a0   Ms. Hunter checked in and could see that Austin was learning more about the [Drive for] block. She challenged him to apply what was learned from converting a block and typing into a new block. She showed how to drag a Switch block in, and had Austin try to type a turn_for command into the block. Austin open the Help for the block and makes a note about the structure of the command.\u00a0 Typing in a Switch Block Add a block                      Knowing the Python command from checking the Help, Austin wants to type directly into a Switch block. Dragging a [Switch Stack] block from the Toolbox, Austin adds it above the [Turn for] block.\u00a0   Type in the block                      Then Austin uses the cursor to select the Switch block and begin typing the turn_for Python command as shown here.\u00a0  After typing in the new command and ensuring the parameters match the original block, the [Turn for] block can be deleted.\u00a0   Ms. Hunter comes around to check on Austin\u2019s progress. She sees the Switch project and asks to see it run to ensure the commands are typed correctly. After verifying the project works, she demonstrates another feature - multi-line blocks. Copy and Paste                      The [Switch Stack] block can have multiple lines of code typed within it. Austin copies the turn_for text and", "start_char_idx": 216882, "end_char_idx": 220932, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd63d09-e03d-4495-8420-2d089bbd731b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd63d09-e03d-4495-8420-2d089bbd731b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "945110df-80c8-487e-8ade-0213c4c1b79e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5184aaa030aeb6f402159b444d821cad776720b2d2067035e5b1ed53dba4bae4"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bc5a116-cae7-4d44-8f91-9d737560859a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0997d893c555aeb33f1dc42825508005da9b876540a3d2819539743ac35fcdb7"}}, "hash": "009079f15d780641fe82de17b82e29735c63a001e3cd118ab6c16b0b35b1a1ae", "text": "can have multiple lines of code typed within it.

Feeling like a master of Drivetrain commands in Python, Austin prints out a certificate and saves the project for next time. Converting Stacks to Switch Later in the school year, Ms. Hunter revisits the Coral Reef Cleanup activity and challenges students to either earn a higher score or use text-based coding. While Austin has been using Drivetrain commands in Switch blocks, this activity is an opportunity to learn more about the equivalent of \u2018C\u2019 blocks and Booleans in Python.\u00a0 Convert wrapper                      Austin long presses or right clicks on the [If then else] block and selects \u2018Convert wrapper and contents to Switch Block.\u2019 This converts the loop and the contents of the loop to a single Switch block.  Note the indentation after the conversion is complete. Multiple commands in one Switch block must have the proper indentation to work as intended.   Additional Switch Blocks While Austin has been exclusively using the [Switch Stack] block, there are additional Switch blocks available. Austin is ready to turn in an improved Coral Reef Cleanup project, but makes a plan with Ms. Hunter to try a new kind of Switch block like those listed below in the next class. Switch blocks follow the same shape conventions as other blocks. The table here shows the comparison between the block shape, its meaning, and the Switch blocks of the same type.     Block Shape Description Block Examples Switch Examples     Hat blocks Start a stack of blocks and are shaped to attach blocks below them.     Stack blocks Perform main commands. They are shaped to attach above or below other stack blocks.     Boolean blocks Return a condition as either true or false and fits inside any blocks with hexagonal (six-sided) inputs for other blocks.     Reporter blocks Report values in the form of numbers and fits inside any blocks with oval inputs for other blocks.     C blocks Loop the block(s) within them or check if a condition is true or false. They are shaped to attach stack blocks above, below, or inside them.             Putting It All Together As Ms. Hunter watched Austin test out typing different Python commands in Switch blocks, she could see how Switch allowed her students to scaffold their own learning. Her students all had different coding experiences before beginning her class, and the challenges within VEXcode VR allow them to code at their own levels. Some students code solely in Blocks, some in Python, and others, like Austin, use Switch to transition into Python coding. Over the next few months, Austin moved to coding exclusively in Python, applying the learning from using Switch to make the transition from blocks to text much easier and smoother.\u00a0 VEXcode VR Switch allows teachers, like Ms. Hunter, to be facilitators of learning while students of all different coding levels complete the same challenge. All while the students, like Austin, feel empowered to try new methods of solving coding activities as they transition from blocks to text using VEXcode VR Switch.  1\u00a0 Weintrop, David, and Uri Wilensky. \"How block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text modalities shape novice programming practices.\"\u00a0 International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction 17 (2018): 83-92 \n66, Using the Python Competition Template in VEXcode V5, The Competition Template is an example project that has commands already included to communicate with the Field Control System during competitions, ensures commands are in compliance with field regulations, and aids in setting up projects in order to avoid complications and disqualification (\"competition\" refers to a VRC event using the official field control hardware).\u00a0\u00a0  Open the Competition Template from the Examples Page    Three sections of the template: Pre-autonomous, Autonomous Mode, and Driver Control      Note: In order for your project to work at a competition, you must leave these functions in your project.

Add commands where the comments indicate for each section.    Use the pre_autonomous Function for any Setup      The\u00a0pre_autonomous function is used for any set-up your robot may need such as calibrating a Gyro, setting variables, or other device settings. These commands will run immediately when the project is started, before the autonomous portion of the match begins.        Ensure that all commands are properly indented to that the guiding line is visible between the\u00a0pre_autonomous and\u00a0autonomous functions. Note: If no setup is needed, this function can remain empty.    Autonomous      The autonomous function is used for controlling your robot during the autonomous portion of a VRC match. Commands within this function will run when the match begins the Autonomous period.        Ensure that all commands are properly indented to that the guiding line is visible between the\u00a0pre_autonomous and\u00a0autonomous functions. Note: If no setup is needed, this function can remain empty.    User Control      The user_control function is used for controlling your robot during the driver control portion of a VRC match.\u00a0 Commands within this function will run when the match begins the Driver Control period. Note: The while True loop is shown above so the robot will respond to input from the V5 Controller for the entirety of the match.        Ensure that all commands are properly indented within the\u00a0while True loop while coding the user control portion. Two guiding lines should be visible as shown here. One because the\u00a0while True is within the\u00a0user_control function. The other to ensure commands are within the\u00a0while True loop.  \n67, Using the Context Menu in VEXcode V5 Python, Right-clicking in VEXcode V5 leads to many options to help you with your Python coding.\u00a0  Opening the Context Menu      Right-clicking on a command or in the programming area will open the Context Menu      Notice the shortcuts on the right side of the Context Menu. These will match with your keyboard depending on your operating system. Here a macOS device is being used.   Changing Font Size      Sometimes it can be hard to read the text commands because the font is too small. Use the 'Font Increase' option to make the commands in the workspace larger.        To make the font smaller, use the 'Font Decrease' option.        If you want to return to the default font size in the workspace, select the 'Font Reset' option   Line Comments      Selecting one of the 'Line Comment' options will allow you to change a command to a comment or vice versa. This is useful if you want to momentarily disable a command and test your project again.                        In the video shown here, each of the three line commands are used to edit what is a comment in the project.   Cut, Copy, and Paste      Using the options in the Context Menu or the same traditional keyboard shortcuts, you can cut, copy, and paste text in your project. This is useful when you want to move code from one location to another or edit large chunks of code in your project.   Command Help and Changing Occurrences                      By right-clicking a command and then selecting 'Command Help' in the Context Menu, the Help information will appear.                        Changing occurrences is helpful when you want to bulk change a set of commands in your project. In the example shown here, the\u00a0drive_for\u00a0command was incorrectly typed, then copy and pasted 3 additional times. By right-clicking on the first command to open the Context Menu, you can select 'Change All Occurrences' and it will select all occurrences of that typed command. Then you can edit the commands as shown in this video.\u00a0Note: Occurrences must exactly match. If one of the\u00a0drive_for commands, in this video, was spelled correctly, it would not be highlighted.

Command Pallet                      The Command Pallet opens all of the available commands and shortcuts that can be used in the workspace. Open the Command Pallet by right-clicking then selecting 'Command Pallet.'  \n68, Using Comments in VEXcode V5 Python, Comments are usually added to projects to explain what a programmer wanted parts of the program to do. Comments are helpful when collaborating and troubleshooting, as they document what the code does without having to reread and comprehend many lines of code. Other programmers can read the comments to understand the code's functionality, and the original programmer can remember what their code does after revisiting a project. Python Comments      All comments in Python start with a # (pound) symbol.        Type any text, numbers, or symbols after the # (pound) sign. Comments typically describe the functionality of the code to help the programmer understand what a piece of code does.        When the comment is complete, press the \"Enter\" or \"Return\" key to go to the next line. Comments only span one line.  \n69, Understanding the Colorization of Code in VEXcode V5 Python, When creating Text projects, the syntax, spacing, indenting, and spelling in your code in very important to ensure that your project runs as intended. The color coding present in the Workspace in VEXcode EXP Python is an extra visual cue that you have entered your code into your project correctly. If there is an unrecognizable component while typing commands into the Workspace, it will remain black (like the user-created category). This can be a useful indicator as you are working to prevent frustration or extra troubleshooting later on. Use the cursor and keyboard to correct errors. As the components are recognized, they will be colorized correctly. The colorization of code follows the following conventions:  Classes     The individual device the command pertains to (i.e. drivetrain, sensor, brain)    Commands     The behavior within the command (i.e. drive, turn)    Parameters     Information about how the behavior executes (i.e. direction, distance)    Structures     Control the flow of the project (i.e. conditionals, loops)    Values     Numerical parameter assigned to the behavior (i.e. number of degrees of a turn)    User Created     User created variables and commands    Comments     The text following a # that will not effect the program.  \n70, Guide to the VEX IQ Brain Screen (2nd gen) , There are many things that you can do and learn by navigating the VEX IQ (2nd gen) Brain screen.

The purpose of this article is to cover what contents from Cortex can be used with the VEX EXP System. Structure Compatibility EXP Structure (metal pieces, wheels, gears) was designed with backwards compatibility in mind. This means, the standard used to create Cortex Structure is the same standard used for EXP. Therefore, the pitch (or distance between holes on structural components) is the same, so Cortex Structure can be aligned and fastened to EXP structure. The EXP System utilizes Star Drive Screws and Low Profile Nuts, so you can fasten your builds more securely than before with rivets, although you can still use whatever you are most comfortable with. When upgrading from Cortex to EXP, hardware, gears, and wheels will work with one another.             Electronics Compatibility The root of EXP is based upon the new VEX EXP Brain. Detailed below, it replaces the VEX ARM Cortex-based Microcontroller. This more powerful Brain allows you to control not only the new sensors and motors found in the EXP Kit, but also most of the Cortex Sensors you are familiar with so you will not have to give up anything when deciding to upgrade. EXP Brain Specifications      Improved Robot  10 Smart Ports on the Brain to communicate with a multitude of motors and sensors 8 3-Wire Ports to communicate with both new EXP Sensors and Cortex Sensors (more information below) 1.7\u201d Color Screen with buttons allowing for a total of 8 stored user projects Built in Inertial Sensor, 6-axis Gyro/Accelerometer Built-in Bluetooth Radio paired with the EXP Controller (more information below) Micro SD Card for Datalogging and Storage The Brain also has a real-time motor and sensor dashboard and built-in configurable drive program, allowing for immediate troubleshooting and demonstration opportunities without the need for coding Programmed in VEXcode Blocks, C++, and Python (more information below)  The EXP Brain replaces the VEX ARM Cortex-based Microcontroller, allowing for a lower barrier of entry to the VEX system with how simple it is to use.   The EXP Brain is able to power and control mostly all of the sensors and motors you have been using and are used to from Cortex. If you are wanting to upgrade to EXP but have reservations that you will lose valuable electronics from Cortex, EXP was specifically designed to still support past electronics, while at the same time introducing much more powerful sensors and motors. Cortex Electronics The following list is of 3-Wire Sensors and Motors from the Cortex System and whether or not they are compatible with the EXP Brain and EXP System.

Once plugged into the EXP Brain, you can either take control of them through the Brain\u2019s Device menu, allowing you to see and control all electronics currently plugged into the Brain, or by using VEXcode EXP. VEXcode EXP replaces ROBOTC, and allows you to configure and code your electronics using either Blocks, C++, or Python.  View this section from the VEX Library for more information on VEXcode EXP.\u00a0 EXP Electronics In addition to all of the Cortex electronics that you may continue to use, there are also a number of improved EXP Motors and Sensors. The Smart Ports provide more complex sensing which results in more accurate data when compared to the Cortex Sensors. The following list includes the Motors and Sensors gained when upgrading to the base EXP Kit.      The V5 Optical Sensor is a combination of the following sensors:  Ambient light sensor Color Sensor Proximity Sensor  The Optical Sensor has a white LED to assist color detection in low light conditions, and can function as a flashlight. The Optical Sensor uses a Smart Port and allows for real-time sensor feedback through the usage of the EXP Brain\u2019s Sensor Dashboard.

Example projects and templates also allow you to observe how different blocks in VEXcode EXP are used.  Using Blocks Example Projects      To open an example project, select the File menu and choose Open Examples.        Icons for many different example projects will be shown. Each icon represents a different project and are colored according to the block categories.        The Filter bar can be used to quickly find a specific type of example.        To open any example, select one from the menu.        Blocks for the example base project will populate in the workspace. These blocks and their parameters can be changed or removed. Additional blocks can be added to modify the example project.        Save and download the example to try it on your robot.    Using Templates      There is also a special type of example called a template.        Templates have a special icon and are used to create a blank project with a preset device configuration.        If using a standard robot build, like the Clawbot, a template can be used to quickly get started with a new project.    Notes in Blocks Example Projects and Templates      Each example project and template contains a note in the workspace.        In an example project, the note provides a short summary for what the project does and also lists the device configuration.        In a template, the description notes which devices are listed in the configuration. Notes can be used to document certain information in a project. For more information on notes, view the Using Notes in a Blocks Project in VEXcode EXP article.  \n76, Using Notes in a Blocks Project in VEXcode EXP, Here are some basic ways to manage notes in projects. Adding a Note to a Project      Right-click or long-press anywhere in the Workspace and select 'Add Note.'        Then, type any text, numbers, or symbols into the note.  Press the \u201cEnter\u201d or \u201cReturn\u201d key to write a multi-line note. Select anywhere in the Workspace when the note is complete.     Collapsing Notes      You can collapse a note by selecting the down arrow in the top margin.     \u00a0   This will collapse the note.    Moving Notes Around      You can move a note by selecting the top margin and dragging it around.    Deleting Notes      You can delete any note by selecting the 'X' located at the top right of the note.     \u00a0   You can also delete a note by right-clicking or long-pressing on it and selecting 'Delete.'    Duplicating Notes      You can duplicate a note by right-clicking or long-pressing on it and selecting 'Duplicate.'  \n77, Using Curriculum Design to Improve Accessibility in STEM and Computer Science, Movements like CSforAll are seeking to address issues of equity and inclusion within the field of Computer Science. CSTA Voice recently published an article highlighting how students with disabilities can be successful in computer science classes, when they are considered and supported.   \u201cWhen students are given appropriate support and accessible tools/curricula, they can succeed. Yet, inclusion of students with disabilities is often hampered by low expectations, as well as pedagogical and accessibility barriers which keep them from being fully included.\u201d\u00a0 - Andrew Bennett, Maya Israel, Ph.D.,", "start_char_idx": 244631, "end_char_idx": 248531, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56a6dce4-9947-466b-8fba-ce740725cb8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "56a6dce4-9947-466b-8fba-ce740725cb8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd75f2c2-891f-4e3e-b419-3ec9bebf3289", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a9c7ff0d3c62f3fcb5d35405bd00879625ab74ed6d8b517f86aabf384748970"}, "3": {"node_id": "6817ae9f-fb1a-4f21-8cd7-6f339466426f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cd9db0fe418d08405cdf3dd89fde9d6c52c90de26e75a66f757d4d219021332"}}, "hash": "441d13bef3fc395e99c74af7aac18f2fe478f859aea38f15012fd4422cf4c572", "text": "fully included.\u201d\u00a0 - Andrew Bennett, Maya Israel, Ph.D., &amp; Johnny Delgado,\u00a0Improving Accessibility in the Classroom With the UDL4CS Interactive Table   The article goes on to describe CSTA\u2019s new UDL4CS Interactive Table resource, and how it can be used to support accessibility in computer science classrooms. Much of the focus is on shaping curriculum and teaching to give options for students to learn, present, and access knowledge in multiple ways. They outline \u201cfive steps for successful implementation\u201d as a guide for how to make the most of classroom experiences to support all learners.  Establish Clear Goals Anticipate learner needs and barriers Measurable outcomes and assessment plan Instructional Experience Reflect  The design of STEM Labs across the continuum aligns well with these steps and the accessibility considerations recommended for supporting diverse learners. This table shows some of the ways that STEM Labs support this implementation process.     Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Step Engage-Play-Share STEM LabsVEX 123 &amp;VEX GO Learn-Practice-Compete STEM LabsVEX IQ (2nd gen) &amp; VEX EXP    1. Establish Clear Goals   Each activity within the Play section of a STEM Lab begins with an animation and explanation that helps teachers and students to establish clear goals about the activity. The images, animations, and words give options to access the goal and communicate about it to be sure that all students know what is expected of them.   IQ 2nd generation and EXP STEM Labs begin with goal setting with the class. After viewing an animation of the end game for the Lab and discussing it, students and teachers work together to establish and document clear learning goals. The videos, animations, discussions and engineering notebook documentation offer options for students to access and communicate about their goals.     2. Anticipate learner needs and\u00a0barriers   The Engage section of a STEM Lab offers a way to access students\u2019 prior knowledge and bridge any knowledge gaps in a low stakes way, in preparation for the Lab\u2019s activities. The Background Information in each Unit allows teachers to anticipate knowledge gaps that they and their students may have, with descriptive information they can share with students to eliminate barriers.   The Learn section of IQ and EXP STEM Labs include student-facing captioned, teaching videos designed to help students access prior knowledge about a certain topic, and bridge any knowledge gaps in a low stakes way. Each video has an accompanying handout to offer additional options for accessing the material, as well as formative assessment questions. Students can review and revisit this content at any time to take the time they need for successful learning.     3. Measurable outcomes and assessment plan   The Goals, Standards and Summary sections of the STEM Labs offer information about how standards are reached through the Lab\u2019s activities. In addition, Objectives are offered with the corresponding Lab activity and assessment to be sure that students are reaching the learning objective during the Lab. Students share their learning in different ways, from discussion to project sharing, offering options for expression to support diverse learners.   The Compete section of each Lesson offers students a hands-on, collaborative way to show their learning through playing the Lesson\u2019s mini-game. Students know what they are trying to accomplish, and teachers can easily see if they have met the Lesson goals by seeing how their robot behaves in the game. The engineering notebook serves as documentation of learning, and gives students multimedia options for how to represent their learning process in a way that is comfortable to them.     4. Instructional Experience   The Play sections of a STEM Lab offer step by step instructions for how to model an activity for students, as well as prompts to support differentiation and facilitate group work. Students work in groups to complete Lab activities, allowing them to work at their own pace, and teachers are given information for how to support learners with extra practice, challenges, and more. Additionally, the Pacing Guide in the Unit Overview gives specific ways to adapt and extend a Unit to best meet all students\u2019 learning needs.

The Practice and Compete cycles of each Lesson and the culminating game allow students to work in groups and tailor their competition strategy to the component of the game or learning goal that they choose. This voice and choice in how to represent their learning through game play offers many options for student engagement, from documenting in the engineering notebook to iterating on the robot build or code to scouting and guiding team collaboration and more. The emphasis on collaboration and teamwork throughout the Lab promotes inclusion of all students, and tactical strategies to support inclusive conversations are given in Lab instructions as well.     5. Reflect   The Mid-Play Break and Share sections of the Lab are designed to give students reflection opportunities to check in and express their learning and questions in a variety of ways. Discussion prompts align with demonstrations and project sharing offering students options for how to express their learning in the way that best meets their needs.   The Debrief Conversation at the end of the Unit offers students an opportunity to share their learning with the teacher in response to the learning goals and discussion prompts. Students can engage in this meeting in a way that meets their needs \u2013 from multimedia presentations to written responses to showing and telling about their engineering notebook.      Inclusivity in Computer Science and STEM is an important issue and one that we can work towards incrementally with each lesson we teach. At VEX, we are working to help make that incremental improvement possible and attainable for all teachers, as well as all students. Want to learn more about the CSTA resources mentioned here?

However, many of these teachers do not have a STEM or CS background to draw from, so are looking for more varied and ongoing professional development opportunities to support their teaching practice.2 The traditional professional development model of in-person, one-off training sessions has value, but comes with many drawbacks. Finding the time to attend, the budget to pay for the training, possible travel, substitute teachers, and the inherent limitations that come with a group session, like scope and a lack of differentiation and personalization, can make the in-person model less effective for teachers. Additionally, a one-time session does not necessarily support teachers when they need professional development or support, and may not offer the content that they find relevant at the time of the PD. VEX Professional Development Plus (PD+) was developed to combat these ongoing issues with traditional teacher PD. What is PD+?   PD+ is a multifaceted online professional learning platform that offers all teachers opportunities for professional growth and learning through continual and sustained training, mentoring, and support. The beauty of PD+ is that it is not just one thing, or a one-off experience \u2013 it is a combination of resources that you can curate for yourself, to help you on your STEM teaching journey.    What\u2019s in a PD+ Training Course? The Training Courses within VEX Professional Development Plus (PD+) offer a unique solution to the challenges of traditional teacher PD, by giving teachers self-paced, hands-on, engaging training, with the opportunity for personalized learning and sustained support through the PD+ platform. Each Training Course is focused on a specific topic or VEX platform, to give targeted course content for all VEX platforms and STEM pedagogy. The courses consist of themed Chapters broken up into smaller Lessons. These video-based Lessons weave together concept knowledge, teacher modeling, and hands-on learning with your own VEX Robotics materials, so that you can have the experience of participating in the STEM Lab lessons that you will end up teaching to your own students. For instance, in the Building with VEX GO Training Course, teachers learn about following build instructions, then actually follow along with a VEX Expert to construct various builds with their VEX GO Kit. They then use these builds in a classroom investigation together, modeled by the Expert in the video, to see how the builds connect to curricular concepts.  The videos are intentionally designed to move slowly, and to build on one another, so that you can move through the course at a pace that best suits your needs and skill level. Training Courses designed for \u2018Getting Started\u2019 begin with things like charging a Battery and updating firmware, then progress to building and/or coding activities. For those who desire extra support and tips, the videos within the Get Started Training Courses offer high levels of scaffolding at the start, gradually removing it as the course progresses. Those who are more comfortable can move through the content at a faster pace, using the links to articles, videos, or build instructions included in each Lesson to guide or extend their learning.  Lessons contain formative assessment questions, and links to the PD+ Community so you can ask questions about the content and engage with other VEX Educators and the Experts teaching the course for individualized learning and interactions. The variety, breadth, and depth of the Training Courses allows teachers to pursue interest-driven professional learning, a hallmark of effective teacher PD.3 PD+ Training Courses Exemplify Effective Professional Development PD+ Training Courses, in tandem with the larger PD+ environment, satisfy the hallmarks of successful PD, providing a significant advantage over traditional, stand-alone, in-person professional development sessions.   Effective professional development should be content focused, incorporate active learning, support collaboration, model effective practice, provide coaching and expert support, offer opportunities for feedback and reflection, and be of sustained duration.4      \u2714  Content focused Courses guide you through the concepts and skills needed to build, code, and teach STEM and CS with VEX Robotics confidently.    \u2714  Incorporates active", "start_char_idx": 260559, "end_char_idx": 265064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9cb1a8f-9bf8-49f2-83e8-593083e869d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9cb1a8f-9bf8-49f2-83e8-593083e869d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b25ba45-d770-4b53-8e81-0731adc6a990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2a04243eedd2e5570ac7f2e663bfe5a5106f7037dc414e228b88d50a5141576"}, "3": {"node_id": "10fa8e79-256e-4bda-9dde-adfa0d556945", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c24d80abbca28edb8b619f3248a1c4ca233d2dc7558cea1d5c8667431f24eaed"}}, "hash": "c30c6b32f737c2426997663e322c780a80e6c2f1d2a9b219eca8dc5acde05f8f", "text": "CS with VEX Robotics confidently.    \u2714  Incorporates active learning Use your Kit to create VEX builds and carry out classroom investigations and activities as you participate in the same hands-on lessons you will be teaching.    \u2714  Supports collaboration Ask questions and get feedback from others in the PD+ Community to collaborate with educators and VEX Experts around the world.

Examples of these qualities include collaboration and interactivity which are important for being able to build knowledge by manipulating learning materials and resources.\u201d - Joshua C. Elliot, The Evolution from Traditional to Online Professional Development: A Review   Courses are not simply product training, but set you up for success by integrating hands-on learning experiences with best practices for teaching and learning. The self-paced nature also gives the freedom and flexibility to spend more or less time in a Chapter as you see fit, aligning personal classroom needs and professional development interests with course content.  \u201c \u201cI find myself logging into PD+ daily as a way to connect, learn and share ideas about robotics in a way that no other platform has available for teachers. I even got to meet all of my new PD+ colleagues in person at the conference! During my planning time, I watch videos that are geared to developing my understanding of robotics. VEX PD+ is the best tool, and one I use on a daily basis to strengthen my STEM teaching skills.\u201d \u2013 Anna V. Blake, K-5 Elementary Technology Integrator  The responsive nature of PD+ and the comprehensive layers of support it provides makes PD+ Training Courses unique in their ability to offer educators the elements of highly effective professional development in a sustainable way. Virtual professional development, like PD+ Training Courses, enables flexible sustained learning with follow-up, which can be more effective than a single workshop.6 Rather than attending yet another in-person session that is too soon forgotten, engage with PD+ to develop STEM teaching expertise, raise students' achievement, and take control of your professional learning journey.

There are two types of Activities available in the VR 123 Playspace, \"flat\" Activities and interactive Activities. View this article to learn more about choosing an Activity in the 123 Playspace.      A \"flat\" Activity is one in which the elements on the Field are fixed, and appear 2-dimensional. The robot can navigate over and around the elements, but can't push them or move them in any way.\u00a0                       interactive-activity.mp4\"&gt;          An interactive Activity is one in which some or all of the elements on the Field can be moved by the 123 Robot.                       flat-interactive-elements\"&gt;          Some interactive Activities combine both flat and interactive elements. In these activities, the robot will be able to move some elements on the Field, and others will be flat and able to be driven over. Elements that can be moved have a more 3D appearance, while those that cannot appear flat.        The Choose Location Button can be used to change the starting position of the VR 123 Robot on the Field. This can make an Interactive Activity more or less challenging, depending on the location chosen. View this article to learn more about setting the starting position of the VR 123 Robot.   Features of the VR 123 Robot in Interactive Activities The VR Robot may have additional features in the interactive Activities.\u00a0      In some interactive Activities, there is a green plow attachment at the front of the Robot that can be used to push elements on the Playground. When the VR 123 Robot turns, the plow attachment may inadvertently push game elements out of the way, so keep that in mind while coding.       In other interactive Activities, the VR 123 Robot may have different Art Ring attachments for added engagement.

If you want your class to work through STEM Labs together at a relatively uniform pace, it is important to think ahead about how you will engage those students who finish building earlier than others. This article provides several suggestions for meaningful learning activities they can complete as the rest of the group finishes building.\u00a0 Have Early Finishers Help Other Students One way early finishers can put their skills to good use and learn while doing so, is by providing building help to students who need it. It's important to work together with your class to establish guidelines for student helpers, so they are able to provide assistance that helps their classmates to learn without stepping in too much and doing the building for them. Have a class discussion about what giving and receiving help from peers should look like and sound like, and create the guidelines together. Here are some suggestions for the kinds of guidelines that you could establish with your class. Helpers  Help only those who ask for help. Help students in the order on the sign-up sheet. Ask questions to be sure what kind of help is needed. Provide suggestions for solving building problems, but do not touch the robot/build.  Students who need help  Ask a helper for help first, before asking the teacher. Be patient and wait your turn. Be specific about the building problem you need assistance with.\u00a0 Try the suggestions provided by the helpers, and ask more questions if needed. Do not expect helpers to do the building for you!  Creating a protocol for classroom helpers ahead of time will ensure that both the helpers and those who are being helped are challenged and engaged. Helpers will need to think carefully about how to communicate effectively, and those who are being helped will still need to use the information provided to engage in the productive struggle required when solving problems. Additionally, creating a sign-up sheet to establish in what order students will be helped can help prevent disagreements about whose turn it is. Once you have established your classroom helping protocols, have students role play the helping procedure to practice it before they actually begin building in your classroom. This will go a long way towards helping students to employ the procedure successfully. Have Students Complete IQ Activities There are a number of IQ Activities students can do independently using pieces remaining in the IQ Kit after a build is completed. Students can be directed to choose from a list of these Activities, or can be assigned specific Activities depending on current learning goals. All of the activities to the left can be done with limited Kit contents.       Wheel It! Tallest Tower Challenge Sammy Rescue Wheel and Axle Lunar Rover Build a Wagon Pinball Wizard Signs Build It, Make It, Engineer It Covered Maze Box Ramp Racers Pendulum Time Hang Out         Additionally, you can assign students an IQ Activity that gives them an opportunity to test their build. For example, if your students have built the BaseBot, they can do the Drive Forward and Reverse Activity. If they have built the Clawbot, they can try The Claw.   For more information about using VEX IQ Activities in the classroom, see this article. Have Students Practice Coding Using VEXcode VR If students are already familiar with VEXcode VR, students can practice coding a Virtual Robot as they wait for others to finish building. Assign students a VEXcode VR Activity that is appropriate for their level of experience for them to complete independently or in pairs. For more information about VEXcode VR, see this group of articles.\u00a0 Create a list of Additional Building Extension Activities Students Can Always Do Another strategy for engaging students who are finished is to create a list of activities students can refer to and choose from when they are finished building. Engaging students in the creation of this list will make the list more relevant to your students and in your particular setting.

This enables you to add color, lines, and drawings to your projects on the Field. You can adjust the Pen width and color, move the Pen up and down to draw, and fill in areas on the Field with color using the Pen.  Setting the Pen Width      The [Set pen width] block is used to adjust the width of the line drawn by the Pen on the VR 123 Robot. The default width is set to thin. The line can be made more fine by setting the Pen width to 'extra thin', or wider by setting the Pen width to 'medium', 'wide', or 'extra wide'.\u00a0        This image shows an example of the difference in line thickness from 'extra thin' (at the bottom) to 'extra wide' (at the top).\u00a0   Moving the Pen      To draw with the Pen on the VR 123 Robot, you must move the Pen 'down' onto the Field using the [Move Pen] block.\u00a0 The default setting for the Pen is 'up', or not drawing on the Field.\u00a0        This image shows an example where the Pen was moved between 'down' and 'up' to draw lines and leave a space between.        Moving the Pen 'down' then immediately 'up' will result in drawing a spot on the Field, as shown in this image.   Setting the Pen Color      There are two ways to adjust the Pen color. The first is using the [Set Pen color] block to set the Pen color to one of four preset basic colors \u2013 black, red, green, or blue. The default color for the Pen on the VR 123 Robot is black.        You can also use the [Set Pen color] block with color sliders to set the Pen color to any shade. Move the sliders within the block to adjust the red, green, and blue values. Move the opacity slider to adjust how solid or translucent your color appears on the Field.        As the sliders are moved, the color in the [Set Pen color] block will change to reflect that color combination. Continue moving the sliders until your desired color is created.        In this example, the [Set Pen color] block is used to draw a multi-colored square.   Filling an Area with Color      You can also use the Pen on the VR 123 Robot to color in an area on the Field, using the [Fill area with color] block. Move the sliders within the block to adjust the red, green, and blue values.\u00a0 Move the opacity slider to adjust how solid or translucent your color appears on the Field. Continue moving the sliders until your desired color is created.        In this example, the [Fill area with color] block was used to color the Field. You can also use this feature to color in shapes that you have drawn with the Pen.\u00a0  \n87, Using the Playground Window in the 123 Playspace, The 123 Playspace in VEXcode VR has several features that enable you to select Activities, set up the Field and VR 123 Robot, change the view of the Field, and more.

This allows the robot to raise and lower game objects on the Field.  The Arm moves in a continuous motion using the [Spin] block. The default position is for the arm to be lowered. The Arm can be moved to a specific position using the [Spin to position] block. The Arm motor can move from 0 degrees (lowest) to 420 degrees (highest). This can be useful when completing tasks like lifting samples onto the Lab.     Robot Sensors      A Gyro Sensor that is used with the Drivetrain. This allows the robot to make accurate and precise turns. The drivetrain heading reports a value from 0 to 359.9 degrees, and clockwise is positive.        The Front Eye Sensor is located on the front of the Virtual Hero Robot, as shown in this image. When the Arm is lowered, the Front Eye Sensor is located between the forks.        The Eye Sensor can report if an object is present, the color of an object, as well as its brightness and hue value.  \n93, Using Example Projects with the GO Competition - Mars Math Expedition Playground, Example projects provide students with an easy way to get started learning how to use different blocks to complete the tasks on the GO Competition - Mars Math Expedition", "start_char_idx": 301613, "end_char_idx": 305517, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac23906f-0644-45a0-ae62-91cd66567084": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac23906f-0644-45a0-ae62-91cd66567084", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e5556-d85f-4dae-9a9c-fef9cd236ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e0b0bcdbae250b2331a610b08a4b6c97620baf9264754fb2070a43af3b5783e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcd064e7-b818-4281-b293-5176eb805104", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d2d377f85bfa68cdf618fdd53cae3d4958a65a97f405662c5cb99f763fcb14e"}, "3": {"node_id": "b45126e8-5856-49bc-85a2-878b3ddfa9bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea4b4cc182cc9ffabe3fc58b0bfa1691b6c97e3fabd985736af4c809ba758ea0"}}, "hash": "2087aa3096750442c3c94671dc6595fb625bf5361f0edaccfbffbd770334ee40", "text": "to use different blocks to complete the tasks on the GO Competition - Mars Math Expedition Playground.

The Pin Tool has several features that can be used to make disassembling easy: the Puller, the Pusher, and the Lever.  The Puller can be used by placing the tool over the unwanted pin, squeezing the handles, and pulling out the pin.  Each handle is also designed to be used for disassembly. One side is constructed to push out pins.  The other side incorporates the Lever, which can be used to pry two beams apart.  View the Pin Tool in action to see how each of the features work.         \n97, Understanding Standoff vs. Hex Nut Retainers, Nut Retainers have many purposes, but one of their major functions is to provide the ability to tighten a nut without the use of a wrench. Although both perform similar functions, there are two sets of retainers in the VEX Ecosystem: one sized to fit #8-32 Nylock and Hex Nuts, the other sized to fit #8-32 Low Profile Nuts and all Standoffs. The purpose of this article is to explain the difference between Standoff Retainers and Hex Nut Retainers. Note: Standoff Retainers are used in the EXP Education Kit and Classroom Bundles.      This image shows the difference in compatible size between Hex Nut Retainers and Standoff Retainers. Note that while only the 1-Post Retainer is shown, the same holds true for all Hex Nut Retainers and Standoff Retainers. For Hex Nut Retainers, the maximum width across flats (or the diameter measured from face to face) on a nut is 8.6000mm (the width of #8-32 Nylock and Hex Nuts), while the maximum width across flats for Standoff Retainers is 6.3500mm (the width of #8-32 Low Profile Nuts and all Standoffs).\u00a0 This means that #8-32 Nylock and Hex Nuts will\u00a0only fit in Hex Nut Retainers, and that #8-32 Low Profile Nuts and Standoffs will only work effectively with Standoffs Retainers. While you can place #8-32 Low Profile Nuts and Standoffs into Hex Nut Retainers, they will not be self-tightened as they are too small to be held in place.   Below is an easy-to-reference chart that explains which nut/standoff is compatible with each corresponding Nut Retainer. All nuts can be found here, all standoffs can be found here, all Hex Nut Retainers can be found here, and all Standoff Retainers can be found here. \n98, Understanding Standoff vs. Hex Nut Retainers, Nut Retainers have many purposes, but one of their major functions is to provide the ability to tighten a nut without the use of a wrench.
