Utilizing a standard three-dimensional pitch system for all VEX plastic pieces, you can build in any direction and always connect pieces back to the rest of the build.\n\nThe VEX plastic construction system consists of the following part categories:\n\nElectronics - Robot Brain, Battery, Motors, and Sensors to bring life and intelligence to your robot.\n\nStructural Components - Beams and Plates [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035955191-How-to-Decide-on-Which-Beam-Specialty-Beam-or-Plate-to-Use] are the building blocks of your robot.\n\nFasteners - Pins, Standoffs, and Corner Connectors [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035955131-How-to-Decide-on-which-VEX-Plastic-Connectors-and-Standoffs-to-Use] are used to connect the structural components.\n\nMotion Components - Wheels [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035955171-How-to-Decide-on-which-VEX-Plastic-Wheels-to-Use], Gears, Pulleys, and other accessories provide motion and additional capabilities to your robot.\n\nMany of these parts come in a variety of colors which allows for a customized and creative robot design.\n\nHelpful aids when using the VEX plastic construction system is the VEX IQ Parts Ruler. This ruler has a 1:1 scale, so parts can be placed directly on the printed version for easy identification. See this article for information about the ruler and links to the printable PDFs. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061223471] This information is advantageous when assembling a VEX IQ Robot Build [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/resources/robot-builds], or searching the VEX product line for a replacement part.\n\n\nSIZING SYSTEMS FOR PARTS\n\nThere are several sizing systems associated with the VEX plastic construction system. These include the Pitch system for Structural products, sizing for Connector Pins, and the sizing systems for Motion products.\n\nfile-BKnVzhaxXY.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756471/file-BKnVzhaxXY.jpg]\n\nPitch is the distance between two successive corresponding points. With the VEX plastic construction system, this is one unit in a three-dimensional grid system. All normal mounting holes are 1x pitch apart (12.7 mm / 0.5\"). Shafts, Standoffs, Corner Connectors, Beams, and Plates are sized in integer multiples of Pitch.\n\nThis allows structural pieces to be referred to as the “number of holes.” Using this method, a 1x12 Beam has a width of one and a length of 12 holes. The 2x Beams and the Plates have a center row of holes running between the grid set of holes. These holes are offset by 1⁄2 a hole which allows for a multitude of additional assembly options. When following a set of VEX build instructions, paying close attention to the count of the holes, is essential for success. When creating custom robot assemblies counting the number of holes can assure structures are parallel and have square corners.\n\nCounting Holes Parallel and Square\n\nfile-Ohm6hAllDt.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756511/file-Ohm6hAllDt.jpg]\n\n  file-eHJtGbMYQf.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725752/file-eHJtGbMYQf.jpg] [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042725752/file-eHJtGbMYQf.jpg]\n\n1x2, 1x4, and 1x6 Beams file-akd1OYuqs6.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042756451/file-akd1OYuqs6.png]\n\nThe 1x2, 1x4, and 1x6 Beams have an additional center hole within their length giving them a line of 3 holes, 5 holes, and 7 holes. This additional hole allows for a shaft to be inserted through the center of the part, or for additional parts to be connected in the middle of the beam.\n\nExample of using 1x2 Connector Pin file-exMvQbRl2j.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725772/file-exMvQbRl2j.jpg]  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042725772/file-exMvQbRl2j.jpg]\n\nConnector Pins are typically used to connect beams, plates, and corner connectors in a parallel orientation. Pins are identified based upon how many beams can be connected together (ex; 1x1 or 1x2), with the \"x\" in the name denoting the location of the flange. In the case of naming connector pins, the term “pitch” refers to the thickness of a beam (6.35 mm / 0.25\" thick). For example, a 1x2 Connector Pin means one side of the pin can be inserted through a single beam and the other side of the pin can be inserted through two thicknesses of beams.\n\nExample of using 1x2 Corner Connector file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725792/file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg]  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042725792/file-nKs8ILtTH0.jpg]\n\nCorner Connectors are typically used to connect beams and plates in a perpendicular orientation. Corner Connectors come in a variety of orientations, allowing for a nearly endless number of options to create three-dimensional designs. Similar to beams and plates, corner connectors are identified based on the height and number of holes.\n\n12 Tooth Gear 10mm Pulley 200mm Tire file-a2Qt0Oq9dn.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756431/file-a2Qt0Oq9dn.jpg] file-idrrd8kyAc.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756491/file-idrrd8kyAc.jpg]\n\nfile-TC8VxBfK37.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725812/file-TC8VxBfK37.jpg]\n\nMotion Products fall into three categories, each with a corresponding sizing identification.\n\nSizing for gears and sprockets uses the number of teeth on the component. For example, a 12 Tooth Gear will have 12 teeth around the circumference of the gear, and an 8 Tooth Sprocket will have 8 teeth around its circumference. Gear teeth are smaller in size than sprocket teeth.\n\nPulley sizing uses the pulley’s diameter in millimeters, so a 10mm pulley has a diameter of 10 millimeters.\n\nTires and Omni-Directional Wheels are classified by the circumference of the tire, which is equal to the distance in millimeters the tire will roll after one revolution. For example, a 200mm Tire will roll a distance of 200 millimeters after it has rolled for one revolution.\n\n\nTIPS FOR ASSEMBLING AND DISASSEMBLING THE VEX PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM \n\nAssembling and disassembling the VEX plastic construction system should be a snap. After completing several builds numerous techniques will be developed. Here are a few examples.\n\n\nASSEMBLING TIPS\n\nUse a 1X Beam for extra leverage when mounting small elements on shafts. Insert the shaft into a hole in the beam above the small element then push down on the beam.\n\n\n\nCapped Pins can be started into a hole and then placed on a solid surface. The pin can be seated by applying a downward force on the component.\n\n\n\nRubber Shaft Collars become softer and easier to install if they are warmed by holding them in your hand for a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\nDISASSEMBLING TIPS\n\nVEX PIN TOOL\n\nPin tool [/hc/article_attachments/360060257272/Pin_Tool.png]\n\nPuller [/hc/article_attachments/360060428911/Puller.png]\n\nThe VEX Pin Tool [https://www.vexrobotics.com/pin-tool.html] has several features that can be used to make disassembling easy. The Puller, can be used just by placing the tool over the unwanted pin, squeezing the handles, and pulling out the pin.\n\nPusher [/hc/article_attachments/360060429011/Pusher.png]\n\nEach handle is also designed to be used for disassembly. One side is constructed to push out pins (such as a 0x2 capped connector) that the tool would normally not be able to grab.\n\nLever [/hc/article_attachments/360060429131/Lever.png]\n\nThe other side incorporates the Lever, which can be used to pry two beams apart.\n\nConnector Pins can be smoothly removed from Smart Motors, Sensors, or Robot Brains using a 1X Beam. Put the 1X Beam onto the pin then twist the Beam while pulling outward.\n\n\n\nRemove Connector Pins by pressing a Beam against the back of the Pin then pull the Pin out the other side.\n\n\n\nStandoffs and Standoff Connectors can be separated by pushing a shaft through the Standoff Connector.\n\n\n\nRemove Corner Connectors by inserting a metal shaft through one of the holes then pull upward.\n\n\n\nWith proper care and good building techniques, the VEX plastic construction system should last for many seasons of creating multiple robot iterations. However, small parts such as Connector Pins can become bent or broken. When this happens the parts should be discarded/recycled and replaced with new parts.\n\nfile-2Rw5czeGQw.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756411/file-2Rw5czeGQw.jpg]\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: October 15, 2021\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Understanding+the+VEX+IQ+Plastic+Construction+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592872-Understanding-the-VEX-IQ-Plastic-Construction-System]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

    "content": "FACILITATING CODING CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENTS\n\nInitiating and sustaining productive and meaningful conversations with students, as they are coding, not only offers insight into their learning, but also contributes to a culture of feedback in the classroom. Good questions can open the door for students to articulate their thinking, actively engage in problem solving, and build resilience.\n\nAnytime students are coding or working with a robot, educators and students together must be cognizant of three main ideas:\n\n * Where am I going? – Do students understand the goal of the challenge or task they are working on?\n * How am I doing? – Can students verbalize or otherwise explain what they are doing with their code and why?\n * Where to next? OR How can I improve? – Are students aware of what the next steps are, or what they are working towards in their coding project? If students have accomplished the task, can they think of ways to improve their code or collaboration?\n\nClassroom conversations between teachers and students are a great way to monitor student progress, while giving students an opportunity to explain their thinking and learning, and make deeper connections to the content and concepts that they are working on. Educators can have a variety of goals when initiating conversation , and being aware of the goal of the conversation can help all involved – whether a whole class, a group of students, or an individual student – engage in a positive and productive process to learn from and with one another.\n\nThe following table offers common educator coding goals, and some examples of questions or prompts that can be used to facilitate conversations toward that goal.\n\nCoding Goals\n\nConversation Prompts\n\nClarification, or assessing surface level understanding\n\n * Can you explain what you’re working on?\n * What do you mean by ___?\n * Can you give me an example of ___?\n * How does ___ help?\n * What is your plan for your project? What is the robot going to do first/second/next?\n * Can you explain the goal of the project for me?\n * How are you breaking down the goal or challenge into smaller steps?\n\nMaintaining focus on problem solving\n\n * What is the problem you are trying to solve\n * What is working well in your code so far?\n * What is a solution we could try? Why do you think that would help?\n * What have you learned from your previous attempts? How can you use that information in your next solution?\n\nThinking about your code\n\n * Can you tell me about your code?\n * How did you break down the goal into smaller steps?\n * How will your code help accomplish the task/solve the problem?\n * How did you organize your code so that it matches your plan?\n * Why did you make that choice in your project?\n * Does your robot accomplish the task? How?\n * When you tested your project, did the robot do what you intended? Why or why not?\n\nIterating with a goal in mind\n\n * What did you notice when you tested your project? What worked? What didn’t? Why do you think that is?\n * What is one change you can make that will help you reach the goal? What makes you say that?\n * How will you know if your change is effective? What will you look for when you test your project this time?\n * What is one thing you could do to improve your project? Why or how would that make it better?\n\nImproving and growth mindset\n\n * What do you need to do next? How will you break that down into smaller steps?\n * What is something you learned from your project when it did not work?\n * Is there another way to solve this problem/challenge? What else could you try?\n * What could you change about your design or project to make it more helpful or efficient?\n\n"

    "content": "THE ENGINEERING NOTEBOOK AS A LEARNING TOOL\n\nBy Jason McKenna\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n\n\n\nEngineering notebooks are a vital part of VEX Robotics competitions. They are also an important learning tool that when effectively utilized can lead to a number of positive student outcomes.\n\n\nTHE NEED FOR ENGINEERING NOTEBOOKS\n\nIn 2020, The National Science Teachers Association drafted a position statement on STEM teaching and learning. The position statement included the following declaration:\n\nSTEM education programs should be grounded in the tenets of constructivism supported by the findings of three decades of cognitive science. Integrated STEM education occurs when\n\n * learning is viewed as an active, constructive process, and not a receptive one;\n * student motivation and beliefs are integral to cognition;\n * social interaction is fundamental to cognitive development; and\n * knowledge, strategies, and expertise are contextualized in the learning experience.\n\nThe following will identify how Engineering Notebooks support each of these tenets of integrated STEM education.\n\n\nPROMOTING ACTIVE LEARNING\n\nIn classrooms that utilize active learning, students engage with information along with their teacher and their peers. Engaging with information includes connecting new information with prior knowledge via a variety of methods such as reading, writing, discussing, explaining, and problem-solving. Research has shown that using tools like engineering notebooks can help students make sense of concepts while participating in active learning.1\n\neng-notebook-04.png [https://kb.vex.com//hc/article_attachments/8692822170772/eng-notebook-04.png]\n\nAn engineering notebook also serves as an ongoing record of student learning over a period of time. Having students record their thoughts and ideas is important because:\n\n * learning is often a slow, deliberate process2, and an engineering notebook is a reflection of that process; and\n * applying grades to the deliberate process of learning can inhibit subsequent learning and student motivation.3\n\nRevisiting an engineering notebook can promote student reflection and sense-making, allowing students to be active participants in their learning process.\n\n\nMOTIVATING STUDENTS\n\nEngineering notebooks are written in each student’s own language and voice. This ownership is highly motivating for students.4 The engineering notebook also allows students to choose what they are documenting, how they are documenting, and what conclusions can be drawn from the documentation. This process allows students to become participants in the assessment process. When students are included in the assessment process, they are more engaged in their learning and teachers are presented with a more accurate representation of student learning.3\n\neng-notebook-02.jpeg [https://kb.vex.com//hc/article_attachments/8692828004500/eng-notebook-02.jpeg]\nEngineering Notebooks Promote Student Interaction\n\nEngineering notebooks are a collaborative tool. Students collaborate in both the documentation process and also using the documentation to guide future activities. Because engineering notebooks are involved in each aspect of the engineering design process, they promote student interaction beyond documentation. Students will collaborate as they decide on improvements to make based upon the information contained in the engineering notebook. The engineering notebook can be used to help students that miss class, because students can refer to the documentation and then ask questions of their peers. Students can also share their engineering notebooks with students outside of their group. This can activate students as instructional resources for one another, which research shows is a very effective way to deliver formative assessment.5\n\nEngineering notebooks also allow students to interact with their teachers. These conversations, in which students report their learning to their teacher, have been shown to have a positive impact on student learning.6\n\neng-notebook-03.jpeg [https://kb.vex.com//hc/article_attachments/8692864871572/eng-notebook-03.jpeg]\nEngineering Notebooks Contextualize Learning Experiences\n\nContextualized learning means that student learning experiences are embedded in an authentic context. When learning is authentic7, it:\n\n * is personally relevant;\n * provides connections to the real world; and\n * has assessment that is reflective of the learning process.\n\nAs was previously identified, each of the characteristics of authentic learning are amplified by engineering notebooks.\n\n\nGETTING STARTED IN YOUR CLASSROOM\n\nVEX IQ and EXP STEM Labs provide the perfect platform to utilize engineering notebooks in your classroom. Engineering notebooks are embedded throughout each STEM Lab, and STEM Labs include a video for students that discusses what engineering notebooks are and how they should be used.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n1 Fries-Gaither, J.

    "content": "\nSELECTING A VEX IQ ASSEMBLY\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. Passive Assemblies\n 2. Motor-Driven Assemblies\n 3. Designing a Game Piece Assembly\n\nEach year at the VEX Robotics World Championship the VEX IQ Challenge game for the next year is released. In addition to this, in classrooms all over the world hundreds of creative games are developed every day. These games have unique game pieces of different shapes, sizes, weights, and purposes. In order to play with these game pieces robot designs need to have specialized assemblies.\n\nEffective and efficient assemblies will give a robot a competitive advantage. Game strategy analysis should be the starting point when deciding on a design. That means asking, \"How is the robot going to play the game?\"\n\nSome other factors to consider when deciding on a type assembly include:\n\n * Are there any specific game rules related to the handling of game pieces or for the robot design?\n * Consider the level of experience and knowledge. Does it match the complexity of the design?\n * Assessing the amount of time available to assemble the design, is there enough time for completion? \n\nFor example, in the 2019-2020 VEX IQ Challenge, Squared Away, a plow could be quickly and easily be attached to a drivetrain which allows the robot to push the Cube game pieces into the Scoring Zones. Whereas, assembling linear lifts on both sides of a robot in order to carry two cubes at a time and place them on the Platforms, along with a roller claw to pick up and score the balls, would require much more planning and time to assemble.\n\nOne of the advantages of the VEX plastic construction system is it allows for many designs and a nearly endless opportunity for creativity. This allows for a wide variety of different types of assemblies and most likely new designs which have yet to be assembled. In order to provide a starting point, here are some descriptions of different assemblies which can be used to play a game.\n\n\nPASSIVE ASSEMBLIES\n\nPassive Assemblies use no motors. The rules of many robotics games limit the number of motors a robot can possess. Designing a passive assembly allows the robot’s motors to be used for additional functions. Passive Assemblies are moved by being attached to a drivetrain or other motor-driven assembly. They can also contain stored energy from Rubber Bands. Passive Assemblies can be some of the easiest and quickest types of designs to assemble, although they can be very complex with manual releases and re-set mechanisms. Some examples of passive manipulators which can be used to play a robotics game include:\n\n * Plows are usually attached to the drivetrain and typically their functions are pushing game pieces around and/or keeping the robot from driving up on game pieces and becoming immobile.\n * Forks and hooks (types of passive claws) are typically attached to an arm and are usually designed to slide under game pieces in order to pick them up or hook onto a bar so a robot can lift itself. \n * Shields are designed to keep game pieces from falling into the robot. \n * Game piece slides are designed to allow game pieces to slide out of the slide and into the goal or scoring zone.\n\nPlow Fork Hook\n\nfile-El56Jwtigl.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756071/file-El56Jwtigl.jpg]\n\nfile-t9a6b27sGP.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042725552/file-t9a6b27sGP.png]\n\nfile-sPryC1Ibay.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042725532/file-sPryC1Ibay.png]\n\n\nMOTOR-DRIVEN ASSEMBLIES\n\nMotor-driven assemblies can have a motor spin an assembly directly attached to a shaft or be assembled in combination with a gear train, chain and sprocket system, or other parts available in the Motion Product line. Typically, motor-driven assemblies take more time and planning to put together than passive assemblies. Some examples which can be used in a robotics game include:\n\n * Arms are usually attached to a tower on the robot chassis and are used to lift another assembly on the end of the arm or to lift the robot off the ground.\n * Claws are usually attached to an end of an arm and are used for grasping an object.\n * Basket/collectors are designed to hold multiple game pieces.  \n * Lifts are assembled to lift other assembles vertically or to lift the robot off the ground.\n * Roller intakes and conveyor belts are used to pick up game pieces.\n\nArm Claw Sample Roller Intake\n\nfile-Jp1nbiAySt.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756111/file-Jp1nbiAySt.jpg]\n\nfile-1ANliCBP3R.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042756051/file-1ANliCBP3R.jpg]\n\nfile-ITnZT8QsYf.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042756091/file-ITnZT8QsYf.png]\n\n\nDESIGNING A GAME PIECE ASSEMBLY\n\nEach game has its own unique set of requirements for play. There is no correct design for any given game, although there are assemblies which are more competitive. The most competitive assemblies are usually the ones which work effectively, quickly, and consistently.\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: June 6, 2022\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Selecting+a+VEX+IQ+Assembly&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035953411-Selecting-a-VEX-IQ-Assembly]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Selecting+a+VEX+IQ+Assembly&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035953411-Selecting-a-VEX-IQ-Assembly]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Selecting+a+VEX+IQ+Assembly&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035953411-Selecting-a-VEX-IQ-Assembly]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

STEM Labs can be adapted in various ways to fit into any classroom or learning environment.\n\n123_STEM_Labs.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083006872/123_STEM_Labs.png]\n\nSTEM Labs are organized by Units, and each Unit contains one or more Labs. Each STEM Lab can be completed in as little as 40 minutes and includes the following three sections: Engage, Play, and Share (optional).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPLEMENT STEM LABS?\n\nSTEM Lab Units provide hands-on, minds-on engagement that encourages students to design creative solutions and innovate through experimentation. Every STEM Lab has a common structure that should make it easy to find what you need.\n\n\nENGAGE\n\nEngage.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083006952/Engage.png]\n\nThis is the “whole class” portion of the Lab where students are introduced to the concepts with a “Hook,\" to allow the students to make a personal connection to the concepts that will be introduced in the Lab. This introductory 'Hook' is further broken down into a guided conversation, through the Acts & Asks section. Here you can see step by step what the teacher will do, and what the students will do, taking the guesswork out of how to connect students to the concepts and activities in the Lab that they may be unfamiliar with.\n\nTroubleshooting_and_Facilitation.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083007152/Troubleshooting_and_Facilitation.png]\n\nGet suggestions from experienced teachers on how to implement the STEM Lab in your classroom with the “Teacher Troubleshooting” and “Facilitation Strategies” sections also found on the Engage page of the Lab.\n\n\nPLAY\n\nThe Play section will guide you through the process of introducing and facilitating activities that provoke STEM thinking, build teamwork, and spark creative problem-solving.The Play section is broken up into two parts (Play Part 1 and Play Part 2) with a Mid-Play Break in between where students have a chance to show their learning, and teachers can check for understanding.\n\nPlay_part_1.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083037791/Play_part_1.png]\n\nIn Play Part 1, activities are introduced through guided practice. Often the students are following along with the teacher, then have an opportunity to practice independently.\n\nMPB.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083037751/MPB.png]\n\nIn the Mid-Play Break, the teacher and students come together to share their learning, ask questions, and check for understanding.\n\nPP2.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083037831/PP2.png]\n\nIn Play Part 2, students work with their groups to expand on the activities in Play Part 1 to build a deeper understanding of STEM Lab concepts and apply creative solutions to challenges.\n\nThe Play sections have a consistent organization around the following verbs to make it easy to follow along and focus on facilitating an engaging experience for your students.\n\n * Instruct - introduces the activities and establishes a shared goal.\n * Model - gives teacher tips on how to make the learning visible.\n * Facilitate - provides discussion prompts to provoke discussion around the goals of the activity, and encourage students to think spatially.\n * Remind - includes prompts to remind students that trial and error is a part of learning.\n * Ask - prompts are given to develop a growth mindset. (“Did something go wrong? Great! How can you use this mistake to improve for when you try again?”)\n\n\nSHARE\n\nShare.png [/hc/article_attachments/360083037851/Share.png]\n\nStudents make their learning visible through demonstrations and discussions in the Share section. We provide prompts for students to share their learning during the Active Share, where students physically share what they have learned by holding up their Coder, showing their 123 Robot driving, or another means of sharing what they have learned throughout the Lab. Discussion prompts are also provided that focus on three areas: Digital Documentation, Student-Driven Visible Thinking, and Metacognition-Reflecting Together.\n\nView this Implementation Guide to see how quickly and easily you can begin teaching a STEM Lab.

    "content": "\nDOCUMENTING PERSISTENCE\n\nBy Aimee DeFoe\n\nOctober 29, 2021\n\n\n\nAs educators, we have fortunately reached the point where we can all agree that persistence is a key habit of mind that is necessary for students’ success in both school and life. I hope we can also all agree that persisting can be taught and learned, and that it should be one of our highest priorities as educators. Documenting persistence is an essential way to reinforce the practice of this habit of mind with your students, while emphasizing it as a shared value in your classroom and school.\n\nA particular project I did with my second graders comes to mind when I think about persistence. My students were super excited about the idea of having their own classroom store. It was November, so I thought this could be a great opportunity to raise some money for charity. The students could make something they could sell, practice charitable giving, and engage in some hands-on math in the process. As it turned out, a great deal of persistence was needed on both my part and theirs to make this project successful. \n\nFrom the beginning of the project, my students could not agree on anything. From what they would make, to the name of the store, to who would do what role and when. Every discussion was contentious and time consuming. The math turned out to be the easy part – the social and emotional learning was much more challenging. \n\nAt the time, I chose to document the academic and charitable giving parts of the project. But I could have chosen to document through the lens of persistence, which would have been a very meaningful learning experience for this particular group of students.\n\nIn my second graders’ store project, compromising was their biggest challenge. The process of deciding what to sell involved not one (as I had planned), but four long conversations to arrive at a solution. They all had wildly varied ideas about what we could make to sell. I had to help them work through the feasibility of their ideas on the way to compromise. No, we can’t make stuffed animals because of time. No, we can’t make a new batch of cupcakes every day because we will make the lunch volunteers insane, and no, we aren’t going to get a new video game launched in three weeks. \n\nStudents who are persisting can see alternative routes to solving problems. For my students, coming to this particular compromise required a whole map of alternative routes. I could have taken a moment to document each of their alternate solutions in a deliberate way – the pros and cons, the final decision, and the reasoning behind it. I could have hung them on the wall for them to examine and discuss, reinforcing for them, and any visitors to our room, how important persistence was in coming to consensus as a group.\n\nDocumentation is an incredibly powerful tool for building our students’ ability to persist in our classrooms. When we engage in the practice of documenting persistence, we are showing our students that we value the process of iteration, and the journey of learning over perfection. It destigmatizes the making of mistakes, allowing students to discuss setbacks objectively and without judgement. It also normalizes for students the idea that everyone learns at their own pace, and a little differently. \n\nWhen students can see their classmates’ learning trajectories and engage in discussions about them in a matter-of-fact way, they are well on their way to building persistence. Additionally, students can use the documentation as an opportunity to support each other as well, building community in your classroom. My kids’ store project would have been an excellent opportunity for using documentation of persistence for building community. In the end, by the way, they compromised by deciding to make lip balm and holiday cards. We raised several hundred dollars to donate to a local children’s charity, selling to students, teachers, and parents in the mornings before school. The store was a hit – even if we did leave a trail of glitter and coconut oil throughout the school in the process!\n\nDocumenting the process of learning a math strategy or essay writing is fairly straightforward, but what about documenting a habit of mind such as persistence? To do so, you must find ways of documenting a process occurring over time. First, you need to find ways of drawing students’ attention to the times when they are persisting. You can help students to notice how they feel when they are persisting, as well as how they feel when their persistence pays off. Also, the best documentation should provoke discussion among students about persisting and how it relates to their learning. \n\nI shared one idea [https://plc.pd.vex.com/t/documenting-persistence-in-your-classroom/294] along these lines recently in the VEX Community. Here are a few other ideas you can use as jumping off points for documenting persistence in your own classroom:\n\n * For younger students create a “looks like”, “feels like”, “sounds like” display around the idea of persisting. Have students contribute and add specific examples to each section from their own learning over the course of several weeks. Take time to discuss them with students (morning meetings and closing circles are great places to have these conversations!)\n\n * Create a class concept map about what persisting is, and then have students create ongoing individual concept maps about their persistence and its effects. Be sure to make time for students to share and discuss them with each other. Revisit these concept maps throughout the year, especially after you have seen growth or persistence in a particular project. By revisiting, students can refine their ideas and reflect on their learning processes as well as products. In my store project, making a concept map of the “deciding what to sell” part of the project would have been a fantastic way to reflect on persisting, as well as how to come to consensus in a group.\n\nconcept map [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Documenting%20Persistence%20Mind%20Map3.png]\n\n * Have students make traditional or digital storyboards documenting various strategies they use for a complex problem solving activity. In the store project, I could have assigned groups of students to create storyboards documenting the persistence needed in different aspects of the project – decision making, learning to create the lip balm, collecting money and making change, etc.\n\n * Students can create timelines of project work that show moments of persistence – each point on the timeline can be a place where students had to try a different strategy as they worked to solve problems. \n\n * Have students create a “Persistence Portfolio” throughout the course of a semester or year that they can share with other students or their parents. We could have made a class Persistence Portfolio for the store project, and documented the persistence students showed in deciding what to make, how much to charge, and what to call the store. Not to mention the persistence they showed in learning to make the lip balm, cleaning up their messes, and at least a dozen more things!\n\ndocumenting persistance [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Documenting%20Persistence%20Deciding%20What%20to%20Sell2.png]\n\n * Involve students in choosing an image as the class symbol for persistence, such as a mountain. Make several copies of the image with space for writing inside included. Create a bulletin board or display where students can take a moment to pause when they notice themselves persisting, and document how they overcame an obstacle. Students might enjoy creating a persistence mascot (I’m thinking superhero here) along these same lines.\n\n * Create documentation of your own persistence along with your students and share it with them periodically, or as part of an existing bulletin board or display. If I had documented the places during the store project where I had to use persistence for my students to see, it would have been a wonderful way to engage them in a discussion about persistence from a different point of view, as well as empathy! \n\nWhen documenting persistence, it is important to keep it a living document, so that it doesn’t just become a stagnant part of your classroom environment, or “a persistence thing we did once” to your students. In order for them to form a habit, they must continue to practice, reflect, and engage with the habit of mind in an ongoing way. One way to do this, is to involve families in the development of persistence, and use your documentation as a conversation starter during parent-teacher conferences.\n\nYou can also assign ongoing persistence documentation as homework occasionally, as another way of getting the conversation going with parents. This can help parents understand why persisting is important, how their students are making sense of the concept of persistence, and how they can help reinforce it at home. Encourage parents to share their own persistence stories with their students. I’m imagining a class persistence project where students interview their parents about ways they have had to persist in their own lives, and create artifacts to share at school. These school/home connections can help parents and students reflect together about how persistence is not just something that is useful at school, but it is a skill they will use for their entire lives.\n\nConsider ways to involve other classes and grade levels in your school in documenting persistence, as well. If you have a hallway bulletin board you can use, invite students from other classes to contribute their own experiences. Invite other classes to join you when students are sharing persistence portfolios or concept maps, or challenge the class next door to document a certain number of examples of persisting by a certain date. Getting the rest of your school involved in an ongoing conversation about persistence can help to ensure that students can continue to develop this habit as they move up through the grades.\n\nThe choices we make about what and how we document students’ learning are extremely powerful, and we can use documentation not just as a way of showing off finished products, but as a tool for helping students to develop the habits of mind that can provide lifelong benefits. Documenting persistence in the classroom sends a powerful message to your students: Learning takes time and practice. It isn’t a straight line, but is often a winding path with many mistakes and setbacks; and that everyone’s journey on that path is different. \n\nAimee DeFoe is a Senior Education Developer at VEX Robotics.\n\nLike this article?

The sensor calculates the distance based on how long the sound pulse took to make the round trip. The Distance Sensor then makes a calculation based on the speed of sound to tell the robot brain how far the nearest object is. \n\nIf the surface is not flat like a curved wall or a ball, the ultrasonic wave does not bounce off of all parts equally or at the same time. The closest surface large enough to reflect back a detectable amount of the wave determines the detected distance of the object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR:\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386891/5dc33fc31bf5e.png]\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386911/5dc33fc3c5405.jpeg]\n\nThis sensor can detect if there is an object in front of it.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372892/5dc33fc595c4b.png]\n\nThis sensor can measure the distance between it and an object.\n\n\n\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive a certain distance away from an object.\n\n\n\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive up to an object without touching it.\n\n\n\n * The values provided by this sensor can be used to adjust the robot’s velocity depending on whether it is near or far away from an object or surface.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to initiate a sequence of behaviors when it is in the correct place to do so. For example, the robot can drive forward until it detects that it is 150mm away from a wall, then turn 90 degrees, and release an object into a scoring zone.  \n * The Distance Sensor can be used to trigger robot actions, such as picking up a game piece, when an object is detected within range.\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive toward an object or surface until it is within a specific distance, without touching it. This can be used to make sure that the robot does not knock over game pieces.\n * A robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive away from an object or surface until it has reached a specific distance. This can be used to avoid collisions with other robots on the field.\n\n\nUSING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN VEXCODE IQ\n\n\nADDING THE DISTANCE SENSOR AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_10.40.38_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13587568086420]\n\nTo code the Distance Sensor in VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Distance Sensor. View this article to learn more about configuring a sensor in VEXcode IQ. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035591252-Configuring-Sensors-in-VEXcode-IQ]\n\nOnce the sensor is configured, commands will appear in the Toolbox that you can use in your project.\n\n\nCODING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN BLOCKS\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_10.43.09_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13587629205652]\n\nThe <Object found> block is a Boolean reporter block that reports a condition as either true or false. Boolean blocks, like the <Object found> block fit inside blocks with hexagonal (six-sided) inputs for other blocks.\n\nThe <Object found> Boolean block reports 'true' if the sensor detects an object, and 'false' if the sensor does not. To learn more about Boolean blocks visit the Help [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041340172-Access-Help-Project-Help-VEXcode-VR] or the Block Shapes and Meaning [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/search/click?data=BAh7DjoHaWRsKwg7r9DTUwA6D2FjY291bnRfaWRpA82yjzoJdHlwZUkiDGFydGljbGUGOgZFVDoIdXJsSSJaaHR0cHM6Ly9rYi52ZXguY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzM2MDAzNTk1NDQ5MS1WRVhjb2RlLUlRLUJsb2NrLVNoYXBlcy1hbmQtTWVhbmluZwY7CFQ6DnNlYXJjaF9pZEkiKTM2NWQ2MzY3LTFmY2UtNDE4OC1hNzJjLWYwNjkxNGI2MWI0OAY7CEY6CXJhbmtpBzoLbG9jYWxlSSIKZW4tdXMGOwhUOgpxdWVyeUkiI2Jsb2NrIHNoYXBlcyBhbmQgdGhlaXIgbWVhbmluZwY7CFQ6EnJlc3VsdHNfY291bnRpAqUC--56cefe6e9a473b42ac82cb230000946766b66fc6] article.\n\n \n\nScreenshot_2023-02-28_at_1.07.13_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13566716464148]\n\nIn this example, the <Object found> block is used with a [Wait until] block to make the robot drive forward until the Distance Sensor detects an object. When the sensor detects an object, the robot will stop driving, as shown in the image above. \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.03.40_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13588287070100]\n\nThe (Distance from) block reports the distance of the nearest object from the Distance Sensor. It reports a range from 24mm to 1000mm, or 1 inch to 40 inches. The (Distance from) block is a reporter block that is used inside blocks with circular spaces.\n\n \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.13.38_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13588609171092]\n\nIn this example, the (Distance from) block is used with a [Print] block to display on the Brain screen the distance between the Distance Sensor and an object. The (Distance from) block is also shown inside a <Less than> block which is inside a {Wait until} block. This will cause the robot to drive until the Distance Sensor detects an object less than 50 millimeters away, and then stop driving. This is shown in the first video above.\n\n\nCODING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN PYTHON\n\nNote: To code a VEX IQ (1st generation) Distance Sensor in Python, it must be connected to a VEX IQ (2nd generation) Brain. The VEX IQ (1st generation) Brain does not support Python.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.31.30_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13589349742100]\n\nThe  command reports a Boolean value of either true or false about the Bumper Switch. \n\nThe distance.is_object_detected command reports 'true' if an object is detected, and 'false' if an object is not detected.\n\nNote: The name of the Distance Sensor that appears in the command corresponds to the name it is given in the configuration. \n\n "

Idler Pins\n 2. Capturing Shafts\n 3. Supporting Shafts\n\nfile-GCswuH6FBi.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042755791/file-GCswuH6FBi.jpg]\n\n\nSHAFTS\n\nThe VEX plastic construction system uses square shafts to allow assemblies to spin or rotate. This square shape allows the shafts to fit into a square socket in the motors and provides a physical connection to drive them. The square shape of the shafts also fits into the square hubs of motion components such as Wheels, Gears, Pulleys, and Sprockets which provides a physical drive connection to spin the components. These shafts are available in a number of selections, each with different features and options:\n\n\nMETAL SHAFTS\n\nThese shafts are intended for high torque situations, such as supporting a large arm assembly. These shafts are also found in the longest lengths of all the shafts.\n\n * 2x pitch length are included in the Foundation Add-on Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2531.html] and the Shaft Add-On Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3057.html].\n * 4x, 6x, and 8x pitch lengths are available in the Super Kit [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2500.html] or the Shaft Base Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3506.html]. \n * 9x through 24x pitch lengths are available in the Long Shaft Add-on Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-4420.html].\n\n\nPLASTIC SHAFTS, CAPPED SHAFTS, AND MOTOR SHAFTS\n\nThese lightweight shafts are for low-torque applications. They are available in 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x pitch sizes in the Super Kit, Foundation Add-on Pack, or the Plastic Shaft Base Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq-shaft.html].\n\nStraight shafts require a shaft collar or bushing to secure components in place.  \n\nCapped Shafts eliminate the need for a shaft collar on the capped side. The cap can secure a wheel, gear, or other motion components.\n\nMotor Shafts include a flange that will capture the shaft when a Smart Motor is mounted directly to a 2X Beam or 4X Plate.\n\n\nIDLER PINS\n\nIdler pins are not shafts and can not be used to drive a component. However, these pins can be used to attach wheels, gears, sprockets, and pulleys so they will be free spinning. \n\nThese pins are available in 0x2 and 1x1 sizes in the Super Kit, Foundation Add-on Pack, and the Plastic Shaft Base Pack.\n\n\nCAPTURING SHAFTS\n\nCapturing a shaft refers to fixing a component to a shaft so it will spin with the shaft, keeping a shaft from sliding back and forth within its supporting holes, or keeping a part/assembly from sliding back and forth on a shaft.\n\nFixing a Component to a Shaft so it spins with the shaft is accomplished when a square hub slides onto the square shaft. The VEX Plastic Wheels, Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys all have square hubs so they are fixed to the shaft as soon as they slide onto a shaft. When an assembly uses beams and/or plates and it needs to be fixed to a shaft a Shaft Lock Plate needs to be used because beams and plates have round holes. A Shaft Lock Plate has a center square hub and attachment holes to allow pins to attach it to a structural component. The square hub of the Lock Plate fixes the component to the shaft when it is slid onto the shaft. The 1x2 Shaft Lock Plate works well with 1X Beams and Specialty Beams. The 2x2 Shaft Lock plate works well with 2X Beams and Plates.\n\nfile-O1uUnzTNJH.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042725352/file-O1uUnzTNJH.png]\n\nKeeping a shaft from sliding back and forth Is accomplished by using a Rubber Shaft Collar or a Shaft Bushing. A Rubber Shaft Collar can be slid onto a shaft and be placed against a supporting structural component so it is oriented opposite to the direction the shaft needs to be kept from sliding. A Shaft Bushing works in a similar manner. The end of a shaft is placed into the square hub on one side of the bushing and the pin side of the bushing is inserted into a hole of the opposing structure component. While there are many instances where a shaft needs to be kept from sliding back and forth, capturing a shaft which is inserted into a Smart Motor drive socket is essential or the shaft may slide out of the socket and it will no longer be driven. As mentioned previously, the Plastic Capped Shafts and the Plastic Motor Shafts have features by which they are already captured in one direction because of their design.\n\nfile-ZbDa33GMqs.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725372/file-ZbDa33GMqs.jpg]\n\nKeeping a part/assembly from sliding back and forth on a shaft can be accomplished in two different ways. One way is to place Rubber Shaft Collars on the shaft so there is a collar on each side of the part/assembly. Another way is to place a Shaft Washer or 0.25x Pitch Spacer on the shaft and between a supporting structural component and the part/assembly. Then slide a Rubber Shaft Collar onto the shaft on the opposite side of the part to capture it from sliding in either direction.\n\nCapture with Rubber Shaft Collars Capture with Shaft Spacer and Rubber Shaft Collar\n\nfile-JY7HRnwoTc.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042755811/file-JY7HRnwoTc.jpg]\n\nfile-GgKEq345gl.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725332/file-GgKEq345gl.jpg]\n\nComponents for capturing shafts can be found in the Super Kit and the Foundation Add-On kit.\n\nfile-LttsliODFY.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042755831/file-LttsliODFY.png]\n\n\nSUPPORTING SHAFTS\n\nFor many assemblies utilizing a shaft, it is important to provide at least two parallel points of support. This can be accomplished by passing the shaft through the holes of parallel beams/plates. Another method is to use a Shaft Bushing on the shaft and inserting the pin side into a hole of a parallel supporting beam or plate. If two supports are not provided, the shaft may pivot slightly up or down on the single point of support and this will make the shaft harder to spin. The heavier the robot assembly the shaft is supporting, the more important it is to provide these two points of support. For example, a decorative hand might be assembled out of beams and specialty beams then fixed to a Shaft and Smart Motor assemble. This light assembly may only need one point of support as the motor waves it back and forth, whereas a heavy arm and claw assembly will need two points of support.\n\nTwo Points of Support One Point of Support\n\nfile-387xlIisec.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042725312/file-387xlIisec.jpg]\n\nfile-bALr6HiLo1.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360042755771/file-bALr6HiLo1.jpg]https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/360042755771/file-bALr6HiLo1.jpg\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n"

Additionally, competition use required an expensive display on both the Brain and Controller to allow for data visualization when away from a computer.\n\nVEX EXP has fewer ports and lower-power motors (5.5W) that are more aligned with classroom needs. Since classroom use always has a computer nearby, the computer's screen along with VEXcode can replace the function of the more expensive screens on the V5 Brain and Controller. Lastly, only large competitions need the expensive VEXnet radio function, allowing EXP to use a more cost-effective Bluetooth solution that is robust for classroom use.\n+\nWill there be a new curriculum for EXP?\nYes. VEX EXP has completely new STEM Labs. Each of the STEM Labs are centered around classroom competitions that use the game field and game objects that are part of the VEX EXP Classroom Bundle.\n * EXP Educators Start Here [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/9834407868180-EXP-Educators-Start-Here]\n * EXP STEM Labs [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/exp]\n\n\n\n * Teaching V5 STEM Labs with EXP Kits [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416111144340-Teaching-V5-STEM-Labs-with-VEX-EXP-Kits]\n * Teaching EXP Stem Labs with V5 Kits [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416090287508-Teaching-EXP-STEM-Lab-Units-with-VEX-V5-Kits]\n\n+\nCan I still code with VEXcode?\nYes. VEXcode for EXP is nearly identical to VEXcode V5.\n+\nHow are EXP kits different from V5 Classroom Kits?\nThe main differences are that EXP allows slightly smaller robots to be built, requires less tool usage while building, and improves overall build speed. Additionally, the part selection allows for more variation in robot design without the need to cut metal parts. This allows builds to be constructed, deconstructed, put away, and re-used from class period to another.\n\nThe EXP Battery has almost twice the capacity of the V5 Battery, allowing for all-day classroom use.\n+\nWhat robots can I build with EXP?\nVEX EXP contains a large selection of parts, so there are nearly unlimited robot designs that you can build.

In fact, the VEX EXP STEM Labs are designed to bring the excitement and engagement of robotics competitions to the classroom. VEX EXP Classroom Bundles contain game fields and game objects for this reason.\n+\nCan I use VEX EXP for the VEX Robotics Competitions (VRC, VEX U or VAIC)?\nNo, the EXP Robot Brain, EXP Robot Battery, and EXP Controller are for classroom use only. However, EXP students will gain valuable knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to V5 and the VRC because the building system, sensors, motors, and coding are identical between the platforms.\n+\nWhat is recommended for classrooms that also compete in the VEX Robotics Competitions?\nWe recommend EXP for the majority of the Classroom Kits so that more students can get hands-on experience with STEM and robotics. Use one V5 Competition Kit to support each of your team robots. Since all the construction parts and devices are compatible, they will seamlessly coexist in classrooms. The aluminum structural parts used for competition robots are easily differentiated from the steel structural parts in the EXP kits. Any part in the VEX EXP kits is legal for the VRC except for the EXP Robot Brain, EXP Robot Battery, and EXP Controller.\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL FAQS\n\n+\nCan I still order the V5 Competition Kits? (276-7030 & 276-7040)\nYes. These two kits will continue to be the standard for the VRC, VEX U, and VAIC Competitions.\n+\nWill I still be able to buy replacement parts for the V5 Classroom Kits? (276-7010 & 276-7020)\nYes. We will continue to carry spare parts.\n"

    "content": "STUDENT-CENTERED ASSESSMENT\n\nBy Jason McKenna\n\nOctober 29, 2021\n\n\n\n“Assessment is something that we have done to students, rather than with them.”\n- John Hattie\n\nI first read this quote in the foreword of Myron Dueck’s wonderful book [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56466462-giving-students-a-say&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532531412000&usg=AOvVaw2jaW6xLV3P88LGOnaYQiZ6], Giving Students a Say: Smarter Assessment Practices to Empower and Engage.  This quote captures the essence of student-centered assessment. \n\n\nWHAT IS STUDENT-CENTERED ASSESSMENT?\n\nDueck offers a great definition of student centered assessment in his book: \n\n“Student centered assessment is a process that should engage and empower students by offering opportunities for student voice, choice, self-assessment, and self reporting.”\n\nThinking about student-centered assessment, begs the question, what is the primary goal of assessment? It is communication [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/eight-essential-principles-for-improving-grading&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179202000&usg=AOvVaw2nBF6PsCsJK0vF-Qr6oyBI]. Assessment allows teachers to identify the student’s current level of learning, and compare that to the desired level of learning. This communication allows teachers to fill in the gaps between realized and desired levels of learning. In thinking about assessment as communication, it makes sense to try to gather as much information as possible. That is where student-centered assessment comes into play. By giving students a role in their assessment, teachers are immediately able to gather far more meaningful and communicative information about learning.\n\nSo where do we begin? If we are going to involve students in the assessment of their learning, we should begin by involving them in the goal of their learning as well. A great way to incorporate student voice and choice in assessment is through creating shared learning targets with your students. A problem in many project-based learning classrooms is that the students are unclear [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3104982&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179203000&usg=AOvVaw2VoCo277MMf7HUzyPCKoEr] about the goal of the activity. This can often lead to confusion and then frustration for both the student and teacher. By co-creating learning targets that are from the point of view of the students, and in their language, we can also ensure that the students clearly understand what is expected. A key difference between learning targets and teacher created lesson objectives (or standards) is that learning targets are in the student’s voice and from their point of view. Again, this is important because getting the students and the teachers on the same page is very important. Not only does this help students participate in assessment, it also helps to create a clear learning goal for all involved.\n\nHaving students engage in this discussion is also an opportunity to foster creativity. Discussing and co-creating learning targets can lead to students making personal connections, examining the lesson from a different perspective, and creating unique insights. These are all examples [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-education/resource/the-four-c-model-of-creativity&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179203000&usg=AOvVaw331ip8VHjaV4m1AMFV-IZe] of student creativity. \n\nNow that we’ve established a shared goal, how do we monitor progress towards that goal in a student-centered way? Our first step should be to just talk to our students via student self reporting. Put simply, if we want to know how students are doing, we should ask them. This seemingly obvious observation comes from the work of professor and educational researcher John Hattie. Hattie’s work has identified student self reporting as an intervention that has one of the largest effects on student learning. Moreover, this intervention, as opposed to something like 1-1 tutoring, is cheap and easy to implement. \n\nIn our STEM classrooms, we don’t want students to get the “right answer'' immediately, we want them to engage in iteration. We also don’t want them to feel as if they can never get the answer – students need to have the right level [https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/goldilocks-and-the-just-right-strategy-for-helping-students-acquire-new-content/] of challenge. When students have opportunities to check their understanding multiple times, it provides information about their learning, while also ensuring that the task is at the correct level of difficulty. In a STEM context, student self-assessment can be thought of as iteration or the engineering design process.\n\nWe know that immediately attaching a letter grade to student iteration can have a negative [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Creativity-Common-Core-Classroom/dp/0807756156&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179201000&usg=AOvVaw2McxqyMwrqRwm_Eke-QZt-] impact on student learning, motivation, and creativity. However, revisiting learning after they make mistakes can raise student learning. Student-centered assessment gives us the chance to further embed iteration into our classroom culture in a powerful way. \n\nUnfortunately, most grading practices are based on tradition [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholarworks.uni.edu/elpe_facpub/3/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635532179200000&usg=AOvVaw0tZdQdqJwQhi7nhSZovQxN], not evidence. Everyone, including our students, wants to know the standards by which they are being evaluated. Student-centered assessment doesn’t remove this – it enhances it. Students can be empowered by the assessment process, when they are active participants in it. We just need to explore how it can be done within our classroom environments. \n\nWhat are some ways you incorporate student-centered assessment into your classroom?

Detecting Proximity\n 3. Common Uses of the Color Sensor\n 4. Color Sensors on a Competition Robot\n    1. Coding the Color Sensor in Blocks\n    2. Coding the Color Sensor in Python\n\nThe Color sensor uses reflected light to detect an object’s color, hue value, grayscale value, brightness, and proximity.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372912/5dc33fc77f6ba.png]\n\nThe VEX IQ Color Sensor is included in the VEX IQ Super Kit and can also be purchased here [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3012.html].\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COLOR SENSOR\n\nThe VEX IQ Color Sensor has multiple modes, which allow it to capture different types of information from its environment. The information it collects is affected by the lighting conditions of its environment as well as the distance between the sensor and the object or surface it is reading.\n\n\nvex-rainbow-circle-graphic_2.jpeg [/hc/article_attachments/13598167740436]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE COLOR SENSOR WORKS\n\nThe Color Sensor can detect both color and proximity.\n\nDETECTING COLORS\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372952/5dc33fca079c4.png]\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386931/5dc33fcaa8beb.png]\n\nWhen in brightness mode, the Color Sensor is used to detect the intensity of all light in the robot’s environment. The more light that reaches the Color Sensor while it's active, the higher the percentage value sent to the Robot Brain.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386951/5dc33fcbbeedb.png]\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386971/5dc33fcc66888.jpeg]\n\nIf the detected brightness percentage is low or unreliable, the Color Sensor’s lamp can be turned on or the lamp’s brightness percentage can be raised by using the following set light to block:\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386991/5dc33fce2efd8.png]\n\nThe Color Sensor can report the color it sees as either a color value or as a hue value.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372972/5dc33fcee80b8.png]\n\nColor values. There are 14 listed colors that the Color Sensor can detect. The colors missing from the image of the block are red, green, blue, white, and yellow.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372992/5dc33fcfabb44.png]\n\nHue values. Hue values are like color values but numerical. The hue value ranges from 0 to 360, like degrees. The color values listed above have their own equivalent hue value ranges. \n\nIt is important when detecting colors and hues that the Color Sensor have the proper amount of light to do so. Be sure to test, also known as calibrating, your Color Sensor in different levels of light and with the lamp set at different levels to determine which is the most reliable setting for your robot’s Color Sensor.\n\n \n\nDETECTING PROXIMITY\n\nThe Color Sensor includes an infrared sensor-emitter. The infrared emitter shines an invisible light and then detects its reflection. If most of the infrared light bounces back toward the sensor, it tells the Robot Brain that an object is close.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042387011/5dc33fd05c167.png]\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE COLOR SENSOR\n\nColor sensors are used in many technology applications where having specific colors on displays or products is important.\n\nSome common uses in daily life include:\n\n * Color calibration tools check if a digital screen is displaying accurate colors, and then adjust the display settings as needed. It is important for graphic artists and any designer who works with color on a digital screen to be able to see exactly the correct color being displayed. Misunderstandings and wasted resources result when the colors are not accurate.\n * Cameras and camcorders use color sensors to adjust settings based on the lighting conditions they are in, in order to enhance their photos and videos by maximizing light levels and enhancing otherwise dull colors. These sensors also allow a photographer to focus on specific colors in their photos.\n * Color sensors are sometimes used in manufacturing, to quickly inspect if a product has the correct color before it gets shipped to a customer. For example, fruits and vegetables that turn colors when ripe or ready to be eaten can be scanned to ensure that they are the correct color to send to market. \n\n\nSome common uses with a VEX IQ Robot include:\n\n * This sensor can be used to detect the color of an object.\n\n\n\n * This sensor can be used to detect and/or follow a line.\n\n\n\n * This sensor can detect whether an object is near.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOLOR SENSORS ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\nRemember, it is important when detecting colors and hues that the Color Sensor have the proper amount of light to do so. Be sure to test, also known as calibrating, your Color Sensor each time you arrive at a new competition site because different levels of light can affect how your Color Sensor performs. Test your project with the lamp set at different levels to determine which is the most reliable setting for your robot’s Color Sensor. \n\nThe information collected by the Color Sensor is useful for programming a competitive robot to respond to a variety of conditions. The Color Sensor can make a competition robot better in the following ways:\n\n * It lets the robot detect the color of an object near the sensor. This is useful if you want the robot to sort differently colored objects, drive up to a specifically colored object, or detect the color of objects as they pass by the sensor.\n * It lets the robot detect how much light is reflected back into the sensor. This allows your robot to drive until it reaches a line on a surface, or even to follow a line.\n * It lets the robot know whether an object or surface is near. This is helpful in determining whether a detected color is a reading from a nearby object or potentially, an anomalous reading of a distant surface or light. \n\n\nCODING THE COLOR SENSOR IN BLOCKS\n\n5dc33fd05c167.png [/hc/article_attachments/360042387011]\n\nThe <Found an object> block is a Boolean reporter block that reports a condition as either true or false. Boolean blocks, like the <Found an object> block fit inside blocks with hexagonal (six-sided) inputs for other blocks.\n\nThe <Found an object> Boolean block reports 'true' if the 'true' if the Color sensor detects an object, and 'false' if the sensor does not.

The robot will then stop driving. This is illustrated in the first video above.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_12.49.57_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13591641521684]\n\nThe (Brightness of) block reports the amount of light detected by the Color Sensor.

Personal safety guidelines regarding Electrical Components:\n    2. Electrical Components safety guidelines for working with your robot:\n\nThis article will cover some precautions and safety guidelines.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nPINCH POINTS\n\n2020-12-08_11-44-58.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079538131/2020-12-08_11-44-58.jpg]\n\nPinch points occur whenever a moving object comes in contact with another object. This could be a wheel which is close to a chassis, an arm with a tower, two gears intermeshing, or any number of things involved with robotics.\n\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES REGARDING PINCH POINTS:\n\nPin_Tool.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079538431/Pin_Tool.jpg]\n\n * Tie back long hair.\n * Remove dangling jewelry, scarves, neckties, or other clothing and/or accessories which may fall into a pinch point.\n * Keep fingers away from any moving parts on your robot.\n * Use the Pin Tool [https://www.vexrobotics.com/pin-tool.html] to place a pin in a tight location rather than placing your fingers into the area.\n * Be cautious when assembling/disassembling Field Tiles and Perimeter Walls [https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq-field.html] of the field for pinch points.\n * Seek immediate medical attention for any pinched areas.\n\n\nPINCH POINT SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR ROBOT:\n\nPinch_points.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079538451/Pinch_points.jpg]\n\n * Turn off your robot before handling it.\n * Stop your robot’s autonomous project from running before handling your robot.\n * Secure arms and other manipulatives when working around them by placing a shaft/pin or trig near the pivot point to stop them from moving (be sure to remove them before you operate your robot).\n   \n   * Shaft/pin: Often there is a hole aligned on the robot’s tower which will allow a shaft or pin to be inserted through the hole and into a hole on the arm or the arm’s gear, which will lock the arm in place.\n   * Trig: Often it is possible to connect a piece of structural plastic between your robot's arm and its tower forming a rigid triangle locking the arm in place.\n * Slowly move all pivot points, wheels, sprockets, and gears to ensure there are no cables, rubber bands, electronics or plastic structures which will be caught by the motion, before powering up your robot.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nFALLING OBJECTS\n\nFalling objects occur when an object’s support is removed. This could be things like a robot driving off a table or a parts bin being dropped.\n\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES REGARDING FALLING OBJECTS:\n\n2020-12-08_11-49-40.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079384632/2020-12-08_11-49-40.jpg]\n\nWear closed-toe shoes when working around or operating robots.\n\nWalk. Do not run.\n\nKeep your work area neat and organized.\n\nSeek immediate medical attention for injuries caused by falls or falling objects.\n\n\nFALLING OBJECTS SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR ROBOT:\n\nCode_Base-EyeForward_Near_Wall.png [/hc/article_attachments/360079384712/Code_Base-EyeForward_Near_Wall.png]\n\n * Position your robot in the lowest possible state when working on it. If the robot needs to be an extended position to work on it, lay it down in a position which is least hazardous.\n * Run your robot on the floor or Playing Field, not on a table or counter.\n * Return extra parts to their storage area as soon as they are no longer needed.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARP EDGES\n\nSharp edges occur if a part breaks or cracks.\n\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES REGARDING SHARP EDGES:\n\n2020-12-08_14-20-45.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079538191/2020-12-08_14-20-45.jpg]\n\nBe cautious for any sharp surfaces on the playing field and game elements. Be sure to report any of these immediately.\n\nSeek immediate medical attention for any cut or scratch.\n\n\nSHARP EDGES SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR ROBOT:\n\ncracks.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079384692/cracks.jpg]\n\n * Check metal and plastic parts for points, burs, or cracks which may have occurred when manufacturing or shipping.\n * Inspect your robot frequently to make sure there are no broken or sharp parts.\n * Carefully replace any parts that have sharp edges immediately.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nELECTRICAL COMPONENTS\n\nMost of the energy for your robot comes from its batteries. The batteries are very safe. However, if they become cracked or damaged then hazardous chemicals can leak out of them. If there is an electrical short that allows the two terminals of the battery to become directly connected, this can be a very dangerous situation and cause extreme heat. The most common cause of electrical shorts are breaks in the insulation of cables or metal debris getting into the Smart Ports of sensors, motors, and brains.\n\nUsing an incorrect battery charger can also damage a battery.\n\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES REGARDING ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS:\n\n2020-12-08_11-48-30.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360079384612/2020-12-08_11-48-30.jpg]\n\nDo not touch the two terminals of a battery at the same time with any part of your body.\n\nIf any part of your robot feels abnormally warm or hot to the touch, alert an adult immediately and move away from the robot.\n\nSeek immediate medical attention for any burned skin.\n\n\nELECTRICAL COMPONENTS SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR ROBOT:\n\nIQ_GO_Batteries.png [/hc/article_attachments/360079384892/IQ_GO_Batteries.png]\n\nInspect your robot for any cracked or frayed cables before powering up and replace immediately if they are found.\n\nInspect all Smart Ports for debris or bent pins prior to plugging in a Smart Cable.\n\nPlace electrical tape over the terminals of batteries when they are in storage.\n\nUse the appropriate battery chargers.\n\nInspect all batteries, sensors, motors, and the robot brain for defects and damage before using, if any are found, store in a safe location and recycle as soon as possible.\n\nThis list of precautions and associated guidelines are not all inclusive of the safety issues associated with working on and competing with robots. They are intended to point out some of the more common safety concerns. Common sense and proper training are your best safeguards. Overall, have fun with your robot and be safe!\n\n"

Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object.                                                                                                             In Lesson 4, students investigate how center of mass can affect their robot's ability to pull objects. They combine this information with the evidence they have gathered on forces in Lesson 2, and on mechanical advantage in Lesson 3, to influence their robot's motion and ability to pull to have the best advantage in the Tug of War competition.\n  Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)                   MS-ETS1-1                      Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution, taking into account relevant scientific principles and potential impacts on people and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions.   Students will continually identify the criteria and constraints of the problem at hand as they build, test, and iterate on their robot design and code in order to create a solution to the Practice and Challenge activities throughout the Unit. In the competition Lesson, students will analyze the competition rules in order to identify criteria and constraints for the competition, and use that information to develop a game strategy in their team.\n  Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)                   MS-ETS1-2                      Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.                                                                                                                            During the Compete section of each Lesson, and during the Tug of War competition, students will scout within and among the teams in the classroom to evaluate solutions to the challenge at hand. Through this process, they will determine what information to incorporate into their game strategy, code, or robot design in order to best meet the criteria and constraints of the challenge or competition.\n  Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)                   MS-ETS1-3                      Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success.                                        Throughout the Practice and Compete sections of each Lesson, and the competition itself, students will continually engage in testing their robot design and code, in order to gather data about their design and code decisions. As students engage in the engineering design process, they will use this data to inform their iterations in order to be more successful in the activity, challenge or competition at hand.\n  Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)                   MS-ETS1-4                      Develop a model to generate data to test ideas about designed systems, including those representing inputs and outputs, for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved.                     Students will test the elements of their robot design, including gear trains, during the Practice activities, and during the Tug of War competition. They will collect data about their design and improve their robot designs based on the data collected in their engineering notebook.\n  International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)   4a                             Students know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems.                                                                                                                 In the Practice and Compete sections of Lessons 2, 3 and 4, students test theories about the best placement of the rope attachment, the best gear train configuration, and the best way to use center of mass to their robot's advantage after gathering information about these design elements in the Learn section of each Lesson.\n  International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)   4c                             Students develop, test and refine prototypes as part of a cyclical design process.                                                                                                                                                                                     Students develop, test and refine their BaseBot designs over the course of Lessons 2, 3, 4, and 5, culminating in the Tug of War competition.\n  International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)   4d                             Students exhibit a tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and the capacity to work with open-ended problems.                                                                                                                                                            The Compete challenges and Tug of War competition offer an open-ended problem solving opportunity for students to engage in collaborative decision-making, analyzing competition rules to gain clarity about the goal of the challenge, and to persevere as they design, test, and refine their code and/or robot design.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP3         Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.                                                                                                                                                                                                       As students engage in collaborative data-based decision making in their groups, they will use evidence from their iterations and documented in their engineering notebooks to construct arguments about design and project choices, and to critique the reasoning of others using data.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP5         Use appropriate tools strategically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   As students develop a plan for their design or code, they will identify the tools they need to create their plan. These may include pen and paper to create written plans in an engineering notebook, or by using a tool like VEXcode IQ and comments in their project to create a plan.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.RP.A.1     Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities.                                                                                                                                                      In Lesson 3, students learn about gear ratios and make connections between the gear ratio and how the ratio relates to the pulling power or speed of a motor on their robot. They will describe this relationship in their engineering notebook during the course of the activity.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.6-8.1     Engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 6-8 topics, texts, and issues, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.                                          As students work with their groups during the Practice and Compete sections of each Unit, they will be discussing how to better improve their robot or code. They will use the information gathered from the Learn section to make informed decisions as a group and record the results of these discussions in their engineering notebook.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.5.8        Recall relevant information from experiences or gather relevant information from print and digital sources; summarize or paraphrase information in notes and finished work, and provide a list of sources.                                                             While students work through the practice and challenge activities, they will be gathering information about their expereience in their engineering notebooks. During competitions in the Unit, groups are encouraged to scout out other teams and observe and record data about the other team's robot, strategy, or code in their engineering notebook and record which team that information came from to properly cite where the information and ideas originated from.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RST.6-8.3    Follow precisely a multistep procedure when carrying out experiments, taking measurements, or performing technical tasks.                                                                                                                                              As students engage in each of the Practice activities, they will need to follow the multistep procedure presented in the activity document, as well as the needed procedures to gather and calculate measurements (like those in Lesson 2) to code their robot to complete the activity successfully and clear the cubes.\n  Common Core State Standards (CCSS)                         CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.WHST.6-8.7   Conduct short research projects to answer a question (including a self-generated question), drawing on several sources and generating additional related, focused questions that allow for multiple avenues of exploration.                                            Through each of their tests and iterations throughout the Tug of War Unit, students are conducting small research projects related to how well their robot is able to accomplish the task at hand with the robot they have designed.

Implementing a STEM Lab - Engage\n 6. Implementing a STEM Lab - Play\n 7. Implementing a STEM Lab - Share\n\nSTEM Labs are designed to be the online teacher’s manual for VEX 123. Like a printed teacher’s manual, the teacher-facing content of the STEM Labs provides all of the resources, materials, and information needed to be able to plan, teach, and assess with VEX 123. Students see the Lab Image Slideshows as their teacher facilitates the Lab, while the teacher has all the discussion prompts, activity steps, and facilitation strategies at their fingertips.\n\nTo plan, teachers can read and review the concepts, activities, facilitation strategies, and discussion prompts for the STEM Lab. To teach, teachers can make the materials their own - presenting the concepts as they facilitate the Lab activities and conversations, and using the Lab Image Slideshows as the student-facing companion throughout the Lab. To assess, strategies are offered in the STEM Labs as well, for teachers to use at their discretion.\n\nSTEM Labs are the toolbox for teachers to pull from, as they bring STEM learning to life in their classrooms.\n\nEvery STEM Lab has a common structure that should make it easy to find what you need. Planning for a STEM Lab starts by looking at the Goals & Standards section then reviewing the Summary section to get a deeper sense of the activities within the STEM Lab, and how long it might take.\n\nAn individual STEM Lab might take approximately 40 minutes in one classroom, while another classroom will choose to complete it over several days. Students may be excited to extend their learning with specific STEM Labs depending on their background with the material, and their personal interests. If you want to extend a STEM Lab further, you can always choose to do the activities from the Choice Board with your class.\n\nSTEM Labs Tile [/hc/article_attachments/360078568771/Stem_Lab_Tiles.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSTEPS TO IMPLEMENT A STEM LAB\n\n 1. Read the Goals & Standards to see how the objectives, activities, goals, and standards for the STEM Lab are all aligned.\n 2. Read the Summary to see what materials are needed and read a brief overview of the STEM Lab.\n 3. Review the Engage Section to read how you will connect the concepts of the STEM Lab with your students.\n    \n    1. Acts and Asks\n    2. Engage\n 4. Review the Play Section\n    \n    1. Play Part 1: Review the given prompts to help guide your students through the activity.\n    2. Mid-Play Break: Read the discussion prompts given to help students transition between activities.\n    3. Play Part 2: Review the given prompts to help guide your students through the activity.\n 5. Review the Share Section to see suggestions for making student learning visible and discussion prompts to use with your students.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nGOALS & STANDARDS\n\nEach STEM Lab begins with student goals and objectives to indicate what the students will be learning by the end of the Lab. These can help to frame the Lab as it is implemented in the classroom. This section of goals, objectives, and standards makes it easy to see what you are teaching and where in the Lab those skills are being taught.\n\nSpecific areas of the Lab (Play Part 1, Engage) are mentioned so that it is easy to see the value of each section of the Lab and pinpoint where each activity and assessment is occurring. Begin each STEM Lab by reviewing the Goals & Standards.\n\nGoals___Standards.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568711/Goals___Standards.png]\n\nEach standard identified has a detailed explanation of where the standard is being met during the Lab. All objectives and activities also align with the identified standards.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA full materials list is available in the summary so that it is easy to gather all needed materials and prepare before beginning the STEM Lab. Each material has a specific purpose and recommendation for how many are needed for the classroom, taking the guesswork out of STEM Lab preparations.\n\nMaterials_Needed.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568731/Materials_Needed.png]\n\nThe Environment Setup section provides tips from experienced teachers on how to organize materials and prepare a space for the Lab activities.\n\nEngage_Play_Share_Summary_2.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568691/Engage_Play_Share_Summary_2.png]\n\nThe Lab Summary provides a quick overview of each section of the STEM Lab: Engage, Play, and Share. When students start to ask what they are doing next, there’s a quick and easy answer ready to go.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING THE LAB IMAGE SLIDESHOWS\n\nEach STEM Lab includes a Lab Image Slideshow, which serves as the student-facing component of the STEM Lab content. Every image in the teacher-facing STEM Labs is included in the Lab Image Slideshow - offering ready-made visual aides, so teachers do not have to make them on their own. The slides can be displayed for students in the classroom, and offer visual context for the conversations, activities, and concepts being taught through the Lab. Teachers move through the slides as they move through the sections of the Lab, using the STEM Lab as reference material for their teaching.\n\nImage_Slideshow.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078432312/Image_Slideshow.png]\n\nThe student-facing materials of STEM Labs are intentionally minimal, as the goal of the STEM Labs is for students to be actively coding, collaborating, and engaging with STEM concepts. VEX 123 is designed to be a hands-on platform, so students are tangibly working to see STEM concepts in action, instead of just reading about them.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING A STEM LAB - ENGAGE\n\nEach step in the STEM Labs is written out to make implementing in your classroom easy! The Engage section explains how to introduce the Lab and help students foster a personal connection with the Lab. Remember, the information in the STEM Lab is a teacher resource, and is meant to be taught from, not directly viewed or projected for student consumption.\n\nTo begin, the Acts and Asks section offers prompts for a guided discussion and demonstration to introduce the concepts explored in the Lab. The Acts give ideas for what to do, and the Asks give verbal prompts for what to say inline with each action. (Again, think of this as part of your teacher’s manual, meant to be read to students, not by students.)\n\nEngage.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078432272/Engage.png]\n\nThe Engage section provides prompts for engaging students further with the Lab concepts and materials. Here you may find guided prompts for conducting an interactive demonstration or to introduce students to materials they will be using in the Lab. Each Engage section follows a consistent format: Instruct, Distribute, Facilitate, and Offer, making it easy to find information when facilitating Engage activities.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING A STEM LAB - PLAY\n\nEach STEM Lab follows the same format for Play sections, making it simple to introduce to your students and to explain what steps they will follow to complete an activity. Again, this material is meant as a teacher reference and should be used to aid in the facilitation of the Lab activities, not read directly by students.\n\nPlay_Sections.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078568751/Play_Sections.png]\n\nPlay Part 1: In this section, you will Instruct, Model, Facilitate, Remind, and Ask students. Each prompt has specific instructions so you never have to worry about how you’re going to facilitate a discussion or instruct the students to do something. Utilize these steps as you would those in a traditional teacher’s manual.\n\nMid-Play Break: Bring your students back together as a class! Ask students the guided questions provided to check for understanding or to clarify any student questions.\n\nPlay Part 2: In this section, you will Instruct, Model, Facilitate, Remind, and Ask students. Each prompt has specific instructions so you never have to worry about how you’re going to facilitate a discussion or instruct the students to do something. Utilize these steps as you would those in a traditional teacher’s manual.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING A STEM LAB - SHARE\n\nShare.png [/hc/article_attachments/360078432332/Share.png]\n\nThe Share section explains how to make learning visible with active sharing, documentation suggestions, and discussion prompts to encourage students to talk about their learning during the STEM Lab.\n\nActive Share\n\n * Bring students together to share projects from the Play section activities.\n\nDigital Documentation\n\n * Capture students engaging in the STEM Lab activities and share with families and your learning community.\n\nStudent-Driven Visible Thinking\n\n * Use these suggestions to create and display artifacts of student learning.\n\nMetacognition - Reflecting Together\n\n * Bring students together in a group.\n\n * Ask students questions from this category to facilitate a discussion.\n\n"

    "content": "RUNNING AN IQ STEM LAB CLASSROOM COMPETITION\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. Organizing your students for competition\n    1. If the competition uses teams, assign teams to your students\n    2. Create a match schedule\n    3. Create a leaderboard\n 2. Setting up your space for competition\n\nThis article is not viewable in your language. Please check back at a future date.\nThis article's translation was completed by machine translation. Please forgive any possible errors.\n\nClassroom competitions bring the excitement of VEX IQ Robotics Challenge to your learning environment, enabling teachers to leverage the creativity and motivation of the competition setting in their classrooms. Organizing your classroom competition will help ensure its success, and make sure that you and your students are on the same page during class.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nORGANIZING YOUR STUDENTS FOR COMPETITION\n\n\nIF THE COMPETITION USES TEAMS, ASSIGN TEAMS TO YOUR STUDENTS\n\nThe teacher should assign teams to the students, to identify which groups will work together in the competition. Post the teams in your classroom in a clearly visible space, so that students can quickly and easily see who they are working with.\n\n\nCREATE A MATCH SCHEDULE\n\nMatches can move more smoothly if you and your students know when they are expected to be ready to compete. Most matches are 1 minute long, but you will need to allow time for setup and clean up, so that students can navigate the classroom space easily. So setting up a schedule that allows for roughly 5 minutes per match, should account for student movement, setup and cleanup.\n\nPost the schedule with the teams, or print it and give it out to students so that they can clearly see when they are expected to be ready. This timetable will then set the parameters for students’ practice time. An example match schedule is shown below.\n\nScreen_Shot_2021-08-10_at_1.46.11_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/4404983099796/Screen_Shot_2021-08-10_at_1.46.11_PM.png]\n\nYou will want to have multiple rounds of the competition so that students can iterate on their strategy and build between matches, so establishing a time table will help you plan your class time to allow for a successful competition lesson. Having a predetermined schedule will also enable you to announce the matches throughout class, so that your focus can remain on scoring and timing at the competition Field.\n\n\nCREATE A LEADERBOARD\n\nPost or project the match schedule on the whiteboard in your classroom, and give space for students to write in point totals and to identify the winner of each match. This visible record of matches can provide motivation for students as they continue to iterate, as well as give them an idea of other teams to scout as they develop game strategies.\n\nYou can also use the VEX IQ Leaderboard [https://education.vex.com/leaderboard/iq] in your classroom. For more information about the VEX IQ Leaderboard and how to use it, view this article [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/5378120747412-Using-the-VEX-IQ-Leaderboard-with-Classroom-Competitions].\n\nIq_blank_leaderboard.png [/hc/article_attachments/5716597227028/Iq_blank_leaderboard.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP YOUR SPACE FOR COMPETITION\n\nThere are three main areas that you should designate within your space for your classroom competition:\n\n * A Competition Field - Have one central competition Field where all matches will take place. This should be easily accessible to all students, and have enough space for students who are not in the match to observe, so that they can scout other teams. This will be the teacher’s main responsibility as your matches are taking place, as you will be responsible for scoring and keeping time, so putting in a centrally located space where you can still supervise your students is optimal.\n * A Practice Area - Have an additional Field, or taped off space, that students can use to practice for their competition matches. If space allows, you may want to have more than one practice area, so that multiple teams can practice simultaneously.\n * Team Meeting and Preparation Spaces - Have several tables or meeting spaces available for alliances to use as their ‘home base’, or ‘pit’, throughout the competition. This will give space for documenting in their Engineering Notebook, meeting to develop game strategy, or building and iterating on their robots.\n\nAn example layout of a classroom space could include a centrally located competition Field, with desks pushed along one side of the classroom as Team Meeting spaces, and a practice space designated on the other side of the room. You will need to determine what works best for your setting, based on your space constraints and the needs of your students.\n\nkb-classroom-comp-layout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4406172889108/kb-classroom-comp-layout.png]\n\nIn this example, the flow within the space would be something like this:\n\n * The teacher would be based between the Competition Field and the Leaderboard.\n * At the end of a match, the teacher announces the winner, and writes the scores on the Leaderboard, while the two groups that competed clear and reset the Competition Field for the next match.\n * The teacher announces the next groups to compete, giving them a “2 minute warning” to the start of their match.\n * Once the Field is cleared, the students who finished competing return their robot to the Meeting Space to strategize for the next round, and the students coming up to play can gather at the Competition Field from the Practice Space and/or Meeting Space.\n\nTo learn more about facilitation strategies during classroom competitions, see this VEX Library article [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404983247636-Facilitating-an-IQ-STEM-Lab-Competition].\n\n"

    "content": "USING THE VEX IQ (1ST GEN) DISTANCE SENSOR\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. How the Distance Sensor Works: Listening for Distance\n 2. Common Uses of the Distance Sensor:\n 3. Uses of the Distance Sensor on a Competition Robot\n 4. Using the Distance Sensor in VEXcode IQ\n    1. Adding the Distance Sensor as a Device in VEXcode IQ\n    2. Coding the Distance Sensor in Blocks\n    3. Coding the Distance Sensor in Python\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThis sensor reports the distance between it and the nearest solid object (50mm - 1m range). It calculates distance by using the time it takes for ultrasonic waves to bounce off of an object and return to the sensor.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386871/5dc33fc0dddd4.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE DISTANCE SENSOR WORKS: LISTENING FOR DISTANCE\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372872/5dc33fc22a694.jpeg]\n\nThe Distance Sensor uses the same principles as sonar devices to measure sound. It sends out a tiny pulse of ultrasound with its emitter at one side of the sensor, and then times how long it takes to hear the sound reflect back the receiver at the other side of the sensor. The sensor calculates the distance based on how long the sound pulse took to make the round trip. The Distance Sensor then makes a calculation based on the speed of sound to tell the robot brain how far the nearest object is. \n\nIf the surface is not flat like a curved wall or a ball, the ultrasonic wave does not bounce off of all parts equally or at the same time. The closest surface large enough to reflect back a detectable amount of the wave determines the detected distance of the object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR:\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386891/5dc33fc31bf5e.png]\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386911/5dc33fc3c5405.jpeg]\n\nThis sensor can detect if there is an object in front of it.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372892/5dc33fc595c4b.png]\n\nThis sensor can measure the distance between it and an object.\n\n\n\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive a certain distance away from an object.\n\n\n\n * A robot can use this sensor to drive up to an object without touching it.\n\n\n\n * The values provided by this sensor can be used to adjust the robot’s velocity depending on whether it is near or far away from an object or surface.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to initiate a sequence of behaviors when it is in the correct place to do so. For example, the robot can drive forward until it detects that it is 150mm away from a wall, then turn 90 degrees, and release an object into a scoring zone.  \n * The Distance Sensor can be used to trigger robot actions, such as picking up a game piece, when an object is detected within range.\n * The robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive toward an object or surface until it is within a specific distance, without touching it. This can be used to make sure that the robot does not knock over game pieces.\n * A robot can use the Distance Sensor to drive away from an object or surface until it has reached a specific distance. This can be used to avoid collisions with other robots on the field.\n\n\nUSING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN VEXCODE IQ\n\n\nADDING THE DISTANCE SENSOR AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_10.40.38_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13587568086420]\n\nTo code the Distance Sensor in VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Distance Sensor. View this article to learn more about configuring a sensor in VEXcode IQ. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035591252-Configuring-Sensors-in-VEXcode-IQ]\n\nOnce the sensor is configured, commands will appear in the Toolbox that you can use in your project.\n\n\nCODING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN BLOCKS\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_10.43.09_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13587629205652]\n\nThe <Object found> block is a Boolean reporter block that reports a condition as either true or false. Boolean blocks, like the <Object found> block fit inside blocks with hexagonal (six-sided) inputs for other blocks.\n\nThe <Object found> Boolean block reports 'true' if the sensor detects an object, and 'false' if the sensor does not. To learn more about Boolean blocks visit the Help [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041340172-Access-Help-Project-Help-VEXcode-VR] or the Block Shapes and Meaning [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/search/click?data=BAh7DjoHaWRsKwg7r9DTUwA6D2FjY291bnRfaWRpA82yjzoJdHlwZUkiDGFydGljbGUGOgZFVDoIdXJsSSJaaHR0cHM6Ly9rYi52ZXguY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzM2MDAzNTk1NDQ5MS1WRVhjb2RlLUlRLUJsb2NrLVNoYXBlcy1hbmQtTWVhbmluZwY7CFQ6DnNlYXJjaF9pZEkiKTM2NWQ2MzY3LTFmY2UtNDE4OC1hNzJjLWYwNjkxNGI2MWI0OAY7CEY6CXJhbmtpBzoLbG9jYWxlSSIKZW4tdXMGOwhUOgpxdWVyeUkiI2Jsb2NrIHNoYXBlcyBhbmQgdGhlaXIgbWVhbmluZwY7CFQ6EnJlc3VsdHNfY291bnRpAqUC--56cefe6e9a473b42ac82cb230000946766b66fc6] article.\n\n \n\nScreenshot_2023-02-28_at_1.07.13_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13566716464148]\n\nIn this example, the <Object found> block is used with a [Wait until] block to make the robot drive forward until the Distance Sensor detects an object. When the sensor detects an object, the robot will stop driving, as shown in the image above. \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.03.40_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13588287070100]\n\nThe (Distance from) block reports the distance of the nearest object from the Distance Sensor. It reports a range from 24mm to 1000mm, or 1 inch to 40 inches. The (Distance from) block is a reporter block that is used inside blocks with circular spaces.\n\n \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.13.38_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13588609171092]\n\nIn this example, the (Distance from) block is used with a [Print] block to display on the Brain screen the distance between the Distance Sensor and an object. The (Distance from) block is also shown inside a <Less than> block which is inside a {Wait until} block. This will cause the robot to drive until the Distance Sensor detects an object less than 50 millimeters away, and then stop driving. This is shown in the first video above.\n\n\nCODING THE DISTANCE SENSOR IN PYTHON\n\nNote: To code a VEX IQ (1st generation) Distance Sensor in Python, it must be connected to a VEX IQ (2nd generation) Brain. The VEX IQ (1st generation) Brain does not support Python.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.31.30_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13589349742100]\n\nThe  command reports a Boolean value of either true or false about the Bumper Switch. \n\nThe distance.is_object_detected command reports 'true' if an object is detected, and 'false' if an object is not detected.\n\nNote: The name of the Distance Sensor that appears in the command corresponds to the name it is given in the configuration. \n\n \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.52.29_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13589752511380]\n\nIn this example, a While loop with a not condition is used with the distance.is_object_detected command to make the robot drive forward until the Distance sensor detects an object. When the sensor detects an object, the robot will stop driving, as shown in the image above.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_11.56.14_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13589871548052]\n\nThe distance.distance command reports the distance of the nearest object from the Distance Sensor. It reports a range from 24mm to 1000mm, or 1 inch to 40 inches.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-01_at_12.03.41_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13590187427348]\n\nIn this example, a While loop with a not condition is used with the distance.is_object_detected command to make the robot drive forward until the Distance Sensor detects an object. When the sensor detects an object, the robot will stop driving.\n\nIn this example, the distance.distance command is used with a brain.screen.print command to display on the Brain screen the distance between the Distance Sensor and an object. The distance.distance command is also shown inside a While loop with a not condition. This will cause the robot to drive until the Distance sensor detects an object less than 50 millimeters away, and then stop driving. This is shown in the first video above.\n\nTo learn more about coding a Distance Sensor in Python, check out Unit 5 of the Computer Science Level 1 - Python course.  [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/cs/computer-science-level-1-python/detecting-walls-from-a-distance/introduction]\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: March 2, 2023\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Using+the+VEX+IQ+%281st+gen%29+Distance+Sensor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592812-Using-the-VEX-IQ-1st-gen-Distance-Sensor]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Using+the+VEX+IQ+%281st+gen%29+Distance+Sensor&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592812-Using-the-VEX-IQ-1st-gen-Distance-Sensor]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Using+the+VEX+IQ+%281st+gen%29+Distance+Sensor&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360035592812-Using-the-VEX-IQ-1st-gen-Distance-Sensor]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

    "content": "TEACHING WITH VEXCODE VR\n\nAdobeStock_332213468.jpeg [/hc/article_attachments/360063360492/AdobeStock_332213468.jpeg]\n\nCOVID Connection: As the COVID situation evolves, many schools have been, or will be, forced to transition to distance or hybrid learning. The VEXcode VR platform was developed specifically to address the need for continued STEM learning in any location.\n\n\nVEX Solution: The VEXcode VR [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-vr]platform offers a free web-based coding experience for students with a virtual robot. This allows students to learn CS and Robotics whether they are in school, or at home. The VR Robot performs across a series of unique playgrounds, giving students the ability to code and problem solve with a more immediate feedback loop for project iteration and design. The VEXcode VR Activities [https://education.vex.com/vr/] offer teachers opportunities for engaging lessons and projects with the VR platform.

It can also be set to display many colors.\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042387031/5dc33fd2445b4.png]\n\nThe VEX IQ Touch LED Sensor is included in the VEX IQ Super Kit but it can also be purchased here [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3010.html].\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nHow the Touch LED Works: Detecting Touches\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042373032/5dc33fd3a7fe4.png]\n\nThe Touch LED uses technology that detects small changes in the physical properties of its surroundings. It does this by measuring capacitance.\n\nCapacitance is a physical property of any object. It can be affected by what a thing is made of, or what it's shaped like. The air around us has a certain capacitance, an electrical circuit has a certain capacitance, and your body has a certain capacitance.\n\nThe Touch LED can detect this capacitance by sending an electrical signal and noting what comes back. In the image you can see that when the button is pressed, the purple response signal changes compared to the blue input signal. If the response signal is just right, it means there is a finger present, and the Touch LED sends a message back to the Robot Brain which means that it's being touched.\n\nOne advantage of checking for touch in this way is that a change in capacitance does not require that you touch the circuit directly, only that you get very close. As a result, the electronics in the Touch LED can be shielded with plastic and packaged along with more electronics, like the multi-color LEDs inside the device.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE TOUCH LED:\n\n * This sensor can be used to start or pause a program at the touch of a finger.\n\n\n\n * This sensor can be used to display different colors at different parts of a program.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nUSES OF THE TOUCH LED ON A COMPETITION ROBOT:\n\n * The Touch LED can be used to start a running program with a finger press.\n * Team members can see when different sections of an autonomous program are running by programming the Touch LED to display a unique color for each section.\n * Using the Touch LED can also be used to help troubleshoot programming problems if issues occur.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING THE TOUCH LED IN VEXCODE IQ\n\n\nADDING THE TOUCH LED AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nScreenshot_2023-03-01_at_3.25.56_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13597019988500]\n\nTo code the Touch LED in a VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Touch LED.

    "content": "DESCRIPTION OF THE GYRO SENSOR\n\nThe Gyro Sensor can be used to keep the robot driving straight and also to make accurate turns. If you want a robot to drive to a location then turn around and return to the same spot, you will need to move straight for an accurate distance, turn exactly 180 degrees, then drive back straight for the same distance. A Gyro Sensor makes keeping straight and turning very accurate. \n\nThis sensor measures its own rotation around an axis. Whenever this sensor is rotated in the direction indicated by the symbol on the top of it, it measures the angle of the turn. The returned measure is in degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise. As the curved arrow on the top of the sensor indicates, the values increase as the Gyro Sensor turns counterclockwise. The values decrease as it turns clockwise.  \n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042372852/5dc33fbce0dc6.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE GYRO SENSOR WORKS\n\nThe Gyro Sensor only detects movements that are clockwise or counterclockwise on the axis indicated on the top of the sensor. So if the gyro is mounted horizontally in the center of the robot, it does not detect if the robot is tilted downward or upward on a slope as long as the gyro hasn’t turned clockwise or counterclockwise. It also does not detect if the robot is tilted or leaning on one side as long as it is still oriented forward. However, a Gyro Sensor can be mounted on a robot’s side or on a manipulator and that would allow it to measure tilt.  \n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE GYRO SENSOR\n\nGyro sensors are integrated into many pieces of technology where knowing the orientation of a device or stabilizing an object are important.\n\nSome common uses in daily life include:\n\n * Gyro sensors are integrated into small motorized vehicles that allow the person to control speed by leaning forward and backward, while also keeping the vehicle stable.\n * Gyro Sensors are used to stabilize large ships as well as monorail trains, in order to keep the people and cargo on them safe.\n * Gyro sensors are used to measure movement in some handheld electronic devices, such as video game remote controls.\n\nSome common uses for a Gyro Sensor with a VEX IQ Robot include:\n\n * Detecting if the robot has turned left or right\n\n\n\n * Detecting whether the robot is tilting up or down by mounting it on the side of the robot\n\n\n\n * Maintaining straight driving\n * Making accurate turns\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nGYRO SENSORS ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\nThe Gyro Sensor can be important for programming a robot for competitions. The gyro is especially important when programming for the autonomous period when the robot has to perform tasks without human input. \n\nThe Gyro Sensor can make a competition robot better in the following ways:\n\n * The Gyro Sensor can detect which direction and how far the robot has turned from its starting point.\n * The Gyro Sensor can detect if the robot is tilting up or down by mounting it on the side of the robot.\n * The Gyro Sensor can be used to detect the status of one of the robot's components (e.g., arm up, arm down, etc) by mounting it on the manipulator or attachment.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING A GYRO SENSOR IN VEXCODE IQ\n\n\nUSING A GYRO SENSOR AS PART OF A DRIVETRAIN\n\nWhen using a Drivetrain on your VEX IQ robot, the Gyro Sensor is built into the Drivetrain, and works automatically to ensure that the robot does things like drive straight and make accurate turns. \n\nScreenshot_2023-03-02_at_11.40.03_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13617760019860]\n\nWhen configuring your Drivetrain in VEXcode IQ, you will be prompted to include the Gyro Sensor as part of the configuration, as shown in this example image. \n\nThere are many benefits to using the Gyro Sensor as part of the Drivetrain. The Gyro Sensor will automatically be calibrated when the robot is coded with Drivetrain commands, and the Drivetrain commands will use the data from the Gyro Sensor to ensure that the robot drives and turns accurately. You do not need to code the Gyro Sensor separately from the Drivetrain in this case, making your project simpler. \n\nScreenshot_2023-03-16_at_4.26.46_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13992749101972]\n\nThe Accurate Turns example project in VEXcode IQ can be used to show how to use the Gyro Sensor to turn the robot using heading and rotation values.\n\nFor information on how to open an example project in VEXcode IQ, see one of the following articles.\n\n * Using Example Projects in VEXcode IQ Blocks [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403663392788]\n * Using Example Projects in VEXcode IQ Python [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408782184596]\n * Using Example Projects in VEXcode IQ C++ [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046514672]\n\n\nCODING A GYRO SENSOR SEPARATELY FROM A DRIVETRAIN\n\nYou can add a Gyro Sensor outside of a Drivetrain, using Gyro Sensing commands.\n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-17_at_12.50.22_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/14015169048084]\n\nWhen coding a separate Gyro Sensor, you must be sure to calibrate the sensor using a [Calibrate Gyro] block or a Calibrate gyro Python or C++ command at the start of the project, to ensure that the Gyro Sensor behaves as expected. \n\nWhen calibrating is taking place, be sure that the robot is completely stationary and not moving, so that the calibration is successful and accurate. \n\nScreen_Shot_2023-03-17_at_12.53.48_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/14015170593044]\n\nWhen coding a separate Gyro Sensor you can use Set Gyro commands, like those shown here for blocks, Python, and C++, to do things like set the current sensor position as the heading or rotation value. \n\n"

While there is a structure to the STEM Labs, they are designed to be flexible, so that they can easily be implemented in the time, space, and teaching style that best meets any class’s needs and environment. A STEM Lab Unit can be completed in a short time frame, or easily extended to enable students to be immersed in the engineering design process, and grow comfortable with iteration, working collaboratively, and learning from mistakes. In addition, the student-facing material lends itself well to implementation in a flipped classroom, or a hybrid setting, where students can interact with the Learn content at home, then engage with the hands-on Practice and Compete sections in class.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSTUDENT-CENTERED ASSESSMENT IS EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT THE UNITS\n\nSTEM Lab Units are designed to bring student-centered learning to life in your classroom. Beginning with the co-creation of learning targets, students have agency over their learning, and are given multiple opportunities to reflect on and self-assess their progress. Formative assessment is embedded throughout the Lessons in the form of Check Your Understanding questions and Wrap Up Reflections. In order to make the most of this, be mindful of your classroom environment and culture, so that students are able to embrace the idea of learning from their mistakes without fear of retribution or a failing grade. The Debrief Conversation at the end of the Unit offers students a way to be an active participant in summative assessment, so that it is something done with students, not simply to them. With a classroom culture that supports iteration and risk taking, students can engage in authentic, real-world problem solving, and learn to see a failure as another opportunity to learn.\n\n\n"

    "content": "CODING WITH VEX IQ SMART MOTORS\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. Motor Encoder\n 2. Coding Individual Motors\n    1. Waiting versus Non-Waiting Commands\n    2. Motor Timeouts\n 3. Coding Smart Motors as Part of a Drivetrain\n    1. Waiting and Non-Waiting Commands\n\nThe VEX IQ Smart Motor has many functions to use when coding in VEXcode IQ. This can come in handy when coding arms, claws, and intakes as well as drivetrains and other mechanisms created using VEX IQ. Understanding how the motors can be coded will help to alleviate issues such as projects stalling or motors not working as intended.\n\n\nMOTOR ENCODER\n\nNot only does the VEX IQ Smart Motor turn electrical energy into mechanical energy, as most motors do, it also has features that most motors do not have, which make it “smart.” One of its main features is the quadrature encoder. This encoder is mounted on the interior of the motor in order to track the speed and/or the position of the motor shaft.\n\nReports from the VEX IQ Smart Motor’s encoder make it possible to know:\n\n * The direction of the motor’s turn (forward/reverse or open/closed)\n * The position of the motor and the amount of the motor’s turn and position (either in turns or degrees)\n * The speed of the motor’s turn (based on the encoder’s position over time)\n\nBecause the encoder reports the motor’s states, they can be used in behind-the-scenes calculations to make many of the Motion and Sensing commands work within the VEXcode IQ.\n\n\nCODING INDIVIDUAL MOTORS\n\nBefore beginning to code individual smart motors in VEXcode IQ, you need to configure the motor. Individual motors are frequently used for additional mechanisms like intakes, arms, and claws. However all of the information does still apply to other mechanisms using individual motors.\n\nimage7.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089828282388]\n\nFollow the steps in this article [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035953011-Configuring-Smart-Motors-in-VEXcode-IQ] to configure your individual motor in VEXcode IQ.\n\nWith a single motor configured, commands to control that motor will appear in the Toolbox. You will notice there are different types of commands: waiting and non-waiting.\n\n\nWAITING VERSUS NON-WAITING COMMANDS\n\nNote that all of the images here show blocks. All of these projects can be rebuilt in Python or C++ and contain the same functionality as blocks.\n\nimage3.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780437652]\n\nWaiting commands block the project from continuing until the behavior is completed. These include commands such as [Spin for] and [Spin to position].\n\nThe project shown here uses a Clawbot (2-motor) template and all of the commands are waiting. So in series, the claw motor would close 90 degrees, the robot would drive in reverse, then the arm would spin up to reach position 180 degrees.\n\nimage6.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780557204]\n\nIn contrast there are non-waiting commands. A non-waiting command will execute the behavior indefinitely or until told to change to another behavior. These include commands such as [Spin].\n\nThe project shown here uses a BaseBot with an intake added. Here the intake motor would begin to spin. The [Wait] command is a waiting command, so the intake would continue to spin until the 2 seconds were up, then move to the next command in the project which is a [Stop] command. Then the motor would stop spinning.\n\n\nMOTOR TIMEOUTS\n\nWhen coding a motor as part of an arm or claw, it is important to remember the difference between waiting and non-waiting blocks and how those will impact the movement of your robot. Motor timeouts allow you to set a time limit for the motor to reach the intended target position. If it has not met that position when time expires, the motor will stop trying to spin and the project will move to the next command.\n\nimage2.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780385684]\n\nIn this example, the motor timeout is set to 2 seconds. If the claw does not close to 90 degrees within 2 seconds, the motor will stop spinning at the 2 second mark then move to the next command and drive forward.\n\nimage4.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089829215124]\n\nIf you are unsure of how far to move a motor, use the sensor dashboard. The dashboard reports the position of the motor in degrees and revolutions, so as you move a motor (like opening and closing a claw) the numbers will change. Use this testing to determine how many degrees or rotations is needed to close a claw, raise an arm, spin an intake, etc.\n\nSee these articles to learn how to use the sensor dashboard.\n\n * Viewing Device Info - VEX IQ (1st generation) [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4963914797204]\n * Sensor Dashboard with VEX IQ (2nd generation) [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908]\n\n\nCODING SMART MOTORS AS PART OF A DRIVETRAIN\n\nBefore beginning to code a drivetrain in VEXcode IQ, you need to configure the drivetrain including the motors used. The motors are configured within the drivetrain to ensure they are controlled with the same commands like [Drive] and [Drive for].\n\nimage5.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780548116]\n\nSee these articles to learn more about configuring a drivetrain in VEXcode IQ. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/sections/360007204832-Robot-Config]\n\n\nWAITING AND NON-WAITING COMMANDS\n\nWhen coding a drivetrain, waiting and non-waiting commands are available to control the movement of the robot.\n\nimage1.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089780302740]\n\nWaiting commands block the project from continuing until the behavior is completed. These include commands such as [Drive for] [Turn for], and [Turn to heading].\n\nThe project shown here uses a Clawbot (2-motor) template and all of the commands are waiting. So in series, the robot would drive forward for 200 millimeters then turn right all by using the drivetrain.\n\nimage8.png [/hc/article_attachments/14089829130132]\n\nIn contrast there are non-waiting commands. A non-waiting command will execute the behavior indefinitely or until told to change to another behavior. These include commands such as [Drive].\n\nThe project shown here uses a BaseBot. Here the robot would drive forward indefinitely until the Bumper Switch was pressed. Then the project would move to the next command and the robot would stop driving and turn right for 90 degrees.\n\n\n"

    "content": "INCORPORATING VEX 123 INTO YOUR CURRICULUM\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. What STEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities Are\n 2. Choosing and Using These Resources Effectively\n    1. VEX Camps\n 3. Tying It All Together – Charlie’s Story\n\nVEX 123 offers a wealth of resources and curricular support to enable you to infuse Computer Science concepts into your learning space easily, creatively, and confidently. STEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities offer varying levels of facilitation and scaffolding. They can be implemented individually or in combination to best match your teaching style and the needs and interests of your students.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT STEM LABS, ACTIVITY SERIES, AND ACTIVITIES ARE\n\nThe VEX 123 platform contains educational resources to support the incorporation of meaningful learning experiences into your existing curriculum. There are three main resources – STEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities – that can be used in conjunction with one another, or as individual engagements.\n\nimage2.png [/hc/article_attachments/4402326106004/image2.png]\n\nVEX 123 STEM Labs function as “plugin” lessons that can fit into your existing curriculum. Multiple STEM Labs can be used in sequential order to create a unique, extended learning experience for your students. You can also use a STEM Lab Unit that ties into what you are learning, to infuse Computer Science concepts into your learning experiences.\n\nTo learn more about implementing VEX 123 STEM Labs, see this VEX Library article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053259871-Implementing-VEX-123-STEM-Labs]\n\nimage3.png [/hc/article_attachments/4402326105364/image3.png]\n\n123 Activity Series offer a sequence of VEX 123 Activities, with supporting Teacher Notes, to create a facilitated lesson with your VEX 123 materials.\n\nTo learn more about implementing VEX 123 Activity Series, see this VEX Library article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402285200148]\n\nimage5.png [/hc/article_attachments/4402319104276/image5.png]\n\n123 Activities are simple one page exercises that connect to the content and coding that students are learning. They lend themselves well to independent student use, such as a Learning Center or as a morning warmup.\n\nTo learn more about using 123 Activities in your classroom, see this VEX Library article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055262652-Using-VEX-123-Activities-in-the-Classroom]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCHOOSING AND USING THESE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY\n\nAs you are looking for ways to incorporate VEX 123 into your curriculum, consider the level of facilitation and scaffolding that you and your students need in order to be successful. All VEX 123 resources can be used flexibly, and adapted to suit your teaching style, comfort level with coding and Computer Science, and your students’ needs. However, each offering has a different level of teacher involvement embedded into it.\n\nimage4.png [/hc/article_attachments/4402326105108/image4.png]\n\nFor a more step-by-step, guided lesson experience, STEM Labs are like your online teacher’s manual. Similar to a printed teacher’s manual, the teacher-facing content of the STEM Labs provides all of the resources, materials, and information needed to be able to plan, teach, and assess with VEX 123. Students see the Lab Image Slideshows as their teacher facilitates the Lab, while the teacher has all the discussion prompts, activity steps, and facilitation strategies at their fingertips. STEM Labs are an ideal way to build student engagement and establish best practices in your classroom for using VEX 123 together.\n\nOnce your students are comfortable using and taking care of their 123 Robots and materials, 123 Activities are a great way to give students the opportunity for more independent exploration. As student-facing documents, Activities do not require much teacher facilitation. Activities fit well in a Learning Center, as an extension activity for a STEM Lab, or as a Choice Time activity for students to practice a variety of skills with VEX 123.\n\nActivity Series sequence multiple Activities, with some teacher facilitation notes and contextualization, to offer a flexible lesson that can easily be used in a variety of settings. Activity Series give teachers a narrative from which to base their lesson, and gives students the opportunity to bring that narrative to life using their 123 Robots. Activity Series can work well as shorter lesson engagements, but do not have a time frame associated with them. They can also be easily stretched to create a more immersive experience by drawing on the use of the 123 Field and Art Ring. These engagements can help to bring students’ and teacher’s creativity to their coding projects.\n\nSTEM Labs, Activity Series, and Activities can be used separately or in conjunction with one another, to infuse Computer Science concepts and practices into your curriculum. The Pacing Guides in each STEM Lab identify strategies to support implementation and reteaching, including connections between the Lab content and Activities. For more information on using the Pacing Guide in a STEM Lab, see this VEX Library article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055275352-Using-the-Pacing-Guide-in-VEX-123-STEM-Labs]\n\nAdditionally, the 123 Cumulative Pacing Guide [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DucwEgwDKvI8YyG8tIUb14Q9nkXbPIgYiJMmJoBs1Q/edit#gid=277290212], and the 1:1 Pacing Guide [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zEM-E7mUyvXXZm9fbZ4nhuE-1atZpt1skFuUOX-AYwc/edit#gid=1201260097] show recommendations for sequencing, and connections between different resources, to help you see at a glance how the 123 resources fit together.\n\n\nVEX CAMPS\n\nVEX Camps sequence STEM Lab Units, Activity Series, and Activities into ready-made camp programs for 1, 3, or 5-day camps. VEX Camps, available at camps.vex.com [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/camps.vex.com], offers all you need to get up and running with your own camp. Camps can be offered all year round, from fall fundraisers to winter break offerings to a summer enrichment program. Everything you need to run a VEX Camp from camp manuals, template schedules, sample flyers, and welcome letters are all available to help take the guesswork out of planning and running a camp.\n\nVEX 123 Camps are tailored to young students. Each schedule is based around a half-day camp and specific support for facilitating conversations and activities with young students is provided in the template camp manual.\n\nScreen_Shot_2022-05-17_at_12.27.44_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/6344075143956/Screen_Shot_2022-05-17_at_12.27.44_PM.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nTYING IT ALL TOGETHER – CHARLIE’S STORY\n\nCharlie has been teaching Kindergarten for several years, and has become increasingly interested in ways to incorporate more Computer Science concepts into his curriculum. He has seen a growing interest in his students, and a natural curiosity and affinity for robots and technology, but his school does not have devices available for Kindergarten. Charlie was delighted when he learned about VEX 123, seeing it as the perfect opportunity to infuse Computer Science into his classroom, without needing student devices. As a bit of a coding and Computer Science amateur himself, he was especially glad to see the curricular resources available for him to use.\n\nCharlie introduced VEX 123 to his students with the Meet Your Robot STEM Lab Unit. His class immediately connected with the 123 Robot as he shared the story with them, and he used the STEM Lab activities and facilitation strategies to help his students learn how to use and take care of their 123 materials in the classroom.\n\nimage6.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/4402319104020/image6.jpg]\n\nHis students couldn’t wait to test out the 123 Robots, so Charlie then taught the Touch to Code STEM Lab Unit over several days, to enable his class to get comfortable coding and using the 123 Robots through fun and engaging challenges. The content of the STEM Labs also tied in well to his literacy curriculum, as he was working on sequencing and decoding simple words to read and write them. At this point, his students were confidently able to use their 123 Robots with growing independence, so Charlie could then add the Activities connected to the STEM Lab to a Learning Center, and offered this as a Choice Time and early morning engagement.\n\nimage1.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/4402326105748/image1.jpg]\n\nAs Charlie’s students were learning to read and write simple sentences, storytelling was becoming a bigger part of their literacy time in the classroom. Charlie saw the Dragon in the Village Activity Series, and knew this would be a perfect blend of coding and storytelling for his class! He added written components to each Activity, to enable his students to practice their written skills, to label scenes or projects to describe the plot or character in the story. His students enjoyed being able to create their own characters with the Art Ring, and he found himself thinking about reusing the Activity series with students’ own stories as they gained writing practice throughout the school year.\n\n"

    "content": "USING THE IQ DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN)\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. Description of the Sensor\n 2. How the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) Works\n 3. Setup of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen)\n 4. Adding the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) as a Device in VEXcode IQ\n 5. Common Uses of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen)\n 6. Uses of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) on a Competition Robot\n\nThe IQ Distance Sensor (2nd gen) is one of the powerful IQ sensors which are designed for complete integration with the IQ robotics platform. This sensor uses a pulse of classroom-safe laser light to measure the distance from the front of the sensor to an object.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407301845524/IQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SENSOR\n\nThe IQ Distance Sensor (2nd gen) has the following capabilities:\n\n * Measuring distance: The sensor uses a pulse of classroom-safe laser light to measure the distance from the front of the sensor to an object. The distance is reported in inches or centimeters on the Brain's Sensor Dashboard, and in inches or millimeters in VEXcode IQ.\n * Detect object: The sensor can also be used to detect when it is near an object.\n * Determine object relative size: The sensor can also be used to determine the relative size of an object that has been detected. The approximate size of an object is reported as small, medium, or large.\n * Report object velocity: The sensor can be used to calculate and report the velocity in meters per second for an object approaching the sensor, or the sensor approaching an object.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor_Mounting.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407294216468/IQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor_Mounting.png]\n\nThe back of the sensor's housing has five holes to provide flexibility when mounting the sensor to a robot.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor-WindowCallout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407301894932/IQ_Gen_2_Distance_Sensor-WindowCallout.png]\n\nOn the face of the sensor there is a small window where the laser beam is sent out and then received in order to measure distance.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Brain_Connected_to_Distance_Sensor_Gen_2.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407302420884/IQ_Gen_2_Brain_Connected_to_Distance_Sensor_Gen_2.png]\n\nIn order for the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) to be functional with the IQ Brain, the sensor’s Smart Port and an IQ Brain’s Smart Port need to be connected with a Smart Cable.\n\nThe sensor will work with any of the 12 Smart Ports on the IQ Brain.\n\nWhen connecting an IQ Smart Cable to the ports, be sure the cable’s connector is fully inserted into the port and the connector’s locking tab is fully engaged.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN) WORKS\n\nThe IQ Distance Sensor (2nd gen) sends out a pulse of classroom-safe laser light and measures the amount of time it takes for the pulse to be reflected. This allows for a calculation of distance.\n\nThe sensor’s Class 1 Laser is similar to the lasers used on modern cell phones for head detection. The laser allows the sensor to have a very narrow field of view, so detection is always directly in front of the sensor.\n\nThe sensor’s measurement range is 20 millimeters (mm) to 2,000 millimeters (mm) (0.79 inch to 78.74 inches). Below 200 millimeters (mm) the accuracy is approximately +/‐15 millimeters (mm); above 200 millimeters (mm) the accuracy is approximately 5%.\n\nThe Distance Sensor (2nd gen) needs to be paired with VEXcode IQ to create a user program for the IQ Brain to utilize the sensor’s readings to control the robot’s behavior.\n\n * See this page to download VEXcode IQ. [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download]\n\nThe IQ Brain in concert with a user project can be used to convert the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) readings into:\n\n * Distance to an object measured in centimeters, millimeters, or inches.\n * Object velocity in meters per second.\n * Object size is small, medium, or large.\n * Object found.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN)\n\n\nPLACEMENT\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Simple_Clawbot_with_Distance_Sensor-Callout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407293761812/IQ_Gen_2_Simple_Clawbot_with_Distance_Sensor-Callout.png]\n\nThe placement of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) is very important to obtaining accurate readings.\n\nBe sure no structure on the robot is in front of the small sensor's window on the face of the sensor.\n\nThere needs to be a clear path in front of the sensor between any object being measured and the sensor.\n\n\nREADING DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN) VALUES\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Brain-On-DistanceMenu.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407302539668/IQ_Gen_2_Brain-On-DistanceMenu.png]\n\nIt is helpful to use the Devices screen on the IQ Brain to see the information the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) is reporting.\n\nFrom the Sensor Dashboard, the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) dashboard reports the distance of the nearest object in either inches or centimeters.\n\nThe units can be changed by selecting the Check button on the Brain to toggle between inches and centimeters.\n\nTo use the Sensor Dashboard, follow the steps in this article.  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908-Using-the-Sensor-Dashboard-on-the-VEX-IQ-2nd-gen-Brain]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING THE DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN) AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nWhenever a sensor is used with a programming language, it needs to be configured within that language. \n\nDistance.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407294480404/Distance.png]\n\nWith VEXcode IQ, this is accomplished by using the ‘Add a device’ feature from the Devices window.\n\nTo add the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) to the configuration, follow the steps in this article.  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035591252-Configuring-Sensors-in-VEXcode-IQ]\n\nDistance_2.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407302741396/Distance_2.png]\n\nOnce the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) has been added to your project, a new set of sensor blocks will become available.\n\nFor more information on the blocks from the ‘Sensing’ category pertaining to the Distance Sensor (2nd gen), view the Help information (Blocks project [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035592352-Accessing-Help-in-a-VEXcode-IQ-Blocks-Project] or C++ project [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046955671-Accessing-Help-in-a-VEXcode-IQ-C-Project]).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN)\n\nThe Distance Sensor (2nd gen) can produce several measurements which can be used to change the behavior of the robot. These features include:\n\n\nDETECT AN OBJECT\n\nfound_object_block.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407488885012/found_object_block.png]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to detect an object when it becomes within the range of the Distance Sensor (2nd gen). The Distance Sensor (2nd gen) will report a found object when it is approximately less than 1000mm away.\n\nThe example project shown on the left is used to code a robot with a Distance Sensor (2nd gen) mounted on the front to turn until it detects an object, such as a cube, and then drive forward once the object is detected by the sensor.\n\n\nDISTANCE TO AN OBJECT\n\nobject_distance_in_mm.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407489361300/object_distance_in_mm.png]\n\nThis provides a measurement between the front of the sensor and an object or a barrier/wall.\n\nThe example project shown on the left is used to code a robot with a Distance Sensor (2nd gen) mounted on the front and a claw attached. The robot will drive until it detects an object is less than 75mm away from the sensor, then close the Claw around the object. This example would be helpful if it is known that there is an object in front of the robot and you want the robot to drive forward to collect that object. \n\nTo determine how far away an object is from the sensor and use that parameter in the project, use the Sensor Dashboard on the IQ (2nd generation) Brain. See this article for more information about using the Sensor Dashboard. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OBJECT VELOCITY\n\nvelocity_example.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407490435220/velocity_example.png]\n\nThis feature provides a measurement of the velocity in meters per second for an object approaching the sensor, or the sensor approaching an object.\n\nIn order to observe the velocity changing with an approaching object, the example to the left can be used. In this project, information will be printed to the Brain's screen. The Brain will print when an object is detected by the Distance Sensor (2nd gen) and the velocity of that object in meters/second. To more accurately see those changing numbers, the print precision is set to 0.1. \n\nTest this project by moving a cube closer and further away from the sensor. When the object and/or sensor are moving away from one another, the velocity values will be negative.\n\n\nDETERMINE OBJECT RELATIVE SIZE\n\nsize_of_object.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407491843604/size_of_object.png]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to identify an object as being small, medium, or large depending on the sensor’s reading.\n\nThis example to the left uses [If then else] and [Print] blocks to print the relative size of an object on the Brain. Place various objects in front of the sensor and look at the readings on the Brain's screen to see the size identification in real time.\n\nTo determine the relative size of an object, the sensor uses information about the amount of light being reflected back at the sensor. Objects should be placed between 100mm and 300mm (about 4-12 inches) away from the sensor to get the most accurate representation of the size.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSES OF THE DISTANCE SENSOR (2ND GEN) ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\nThe Distance Sensor (2nd gen) will provide a superior competitive advantage for competition robots. The ability to detect distance to the perimeter wall and be able to measure a robot's velocity will provide a great deal of information when designing autonomous routines. Object detection and determining the object’s relative size will provide helpful information with the detection of game pieces and or goals.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Fling_-_Distance_Callout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407295823508/IQ_Gen_2_Fling_-_Distance_Callout.png]\n\nFor example, in the 2021 - 2022 VEX IQ Challenge, Pitching In, a Distance Sensor (2nd gen) could be mounted on the back of your robot to detect walls when driving in reverse.\n\nThis can help automate movements, especially when retrieving a ball into the intake, driving in reverse, and then turning to launch the ball into the goal.\n\nNo matter what the application the VEX IQ Distance Sensor (2nd gen) is used for, there is no doubt it will be a welcomed addition for teams.\n\nThe function of the sensor’s values are open for the imagination of the user.\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: February 21, 2022\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Using+the+IQ+Distance+Sensor+%282nd+gen%29+&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407296307348-Using-the-IQ-Distance-Sensor-2nd-gen-]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Using+the+IQ+Distance+Sensor+%282nd+gen%29+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407296307348-Using-the-IQ-Distance-Sensor-2nd-gen-]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Using+the+IQ+Distance+Sensor+%282nd+gen%29+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407296307348-Using-the-IQ-Distance-Sensor-2nd-gen-]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

Please forgive any possible errors.\n\n\nVEX IQ offers a wealth of resources and curricular support to enable you to infuse science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts into your learning space easily, creatively, and confidently using technology and engineering. VEX IQ educational offerings afford several levels of facilitation and scaffolding. They can be implemented individually or in combination to best match your teaching style and the needs and interests of your students.\n\n\nWHAT ARE STEM LABS?\n\nSTEM Labs are lessons that can be incorporated into your existing curriculum, utilizing multiple STEM Labs to create unique, extended learning experiences. STEM Labs promote collaboration and exploratory learning. VEX IQ STEM Labs have two formats: Classroom competitions and SPARK.\n\nclassroom-iq-2.png [/hc/article_attachments/5915720396308/classroom-iq-2.png]\n\n\nCLASSROOM COMPETITIONS\n\nClassroom competitions are a great way to promote the exchange of ideas through shared learning, and bolster the connection of a student's experiences to the world around them. VEX IQ (2nd generation) STEM Lab Units are centered around classroom competitions, leveraging the motivation and excitement of a competition to support students' STEM learning. These Units are all designed around the Learn - Practice - Compete format to be used with VEX IQ (2nd generation) Kits.\n\nScreen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.31.18_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/5916606361620/Screen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.31.18_PM.png]\n\nIn the Learn section, students can watch direct instruction videos from VEX Experts about engineering and coding concepts.\n\nScreen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.32.17_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/5916646491284/Screen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.32.17_PM.png]\n\nIn the Practice section, students will apply the knowledge from the Learn videos in a practice activity. These activities are designed to help students incrementally build their skills before they get to the final classroom competition.\n\nScreen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.33.38_PM.png [/hc/article_attachments/5916666917652/Screen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_5.33.38_PM.png]\n\nAfter practicing their coding, engineering, or strategy skills, students will move into the Compete section. Here they will participate in a full classroom competition. These competitions offer authentic applications; giving the students a way for them to understand the changing world around them through computational thinking and engineering constructs. For more information about implementing a VEX IQ (2nd generation) STEM Lab Unit in your classroom, see this article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409682120724-Implementing-STEM-Lab-Units-with-VEX-IQ-2nd-gen-]\n\nThrough competition participation, students are encouraged to iterate and experiment with their code, to try new things, and to actively learn from others. The goal is not simply accomplishing the task, but creating a solution that works better, faster, or more efficiently than other possible solutions.\n\nStudents can compete against each other in pairs, groups or the entire class. No matter how you want to implement your classroom competition, there is support for Facilitating an IQ STEM Lab Competition [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404983247636-Facilitating-an-IQ-STEM-Lab-Competition] that you can follow. Each IQ Education Bundle contains everything you need, including configurable game fields and game objects. These fields assemble quickly in a variety of shapes and sizes, perfect for any classroom layout.\n\n\nSPARK STEM LABS\n\nSPARK STEM Labs challenge students through another set process. These STEM Labs are written for use with VEX IQ (1st generation) Kits. SPARK STEM Labs follow a sequence of learning experiences. The learner is asked to do the following:\n\n * Create a build or an artifact.\n * Explore the build or the artifact and speculate as to its possible application in the real world.\n * Learn by doing.\n * Make changes to a design or a build to improve and enhance it.\n * Assess knowledge.\n\nIn the Seek section, students build their robot by following a set of build instructions. Then students move into the Play sections where they follow guided instruction to explore the new skill or concept introduced. In Apply, students will read about the real world and competition connections to the concepts they are learning about. In Rethink, students are given a challenge. They will need to apply their knowledge from Play and work collaboratively with their groups to solve the challenge. Finally in Know, students can check their understanding with questions.\n\n\nWHAT ARE ACTIVITIES?\n\nActivity.png [/hc/article_attachments/5836232692628/Activity.png]\n\nVEX IQ Activities [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/iq/activities?lng=en] have been created for use with VEX IQ (2nd generation) Kits to support meaningful learning experiences for your robotic curriculum. They can easily be adapted for use with VEX IQ (1st generation) Kits. Activities are simple one page student engagements that can be completed independently as a quick lesson, learning center or as a supplement to the VEX IQ STEM Labs. Each activity focuses on a skill related to either building or coding and is enhanced with extended challenges and pro tips.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nWHERE DO I START?\n\nIf you are just introducing robotics to your students for the first time, it is easy to get your program up and running.  \n\nimage7.png [/hc/article_attachments/5915890195860/image7.png]\n\nFirst, review the Get Started page for IQ [https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq/support/iq-guide]. This includes a lot of great information on the product itself, as well as educator resources, curriculum information, current research on VEX, standards alignment, information education support, and more.\n\nimage9.png [/hc/article_attachments/5915881193236/image9.png]\n\nNext, review the Get Started section of the VEX Library [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002324792-IQ?sc=get-started]. This includes great information especially in the first couple articles about reviewing your Kit or Bundle, how to get started by charging batteries and downloading software, as well as where to find information about how to get started building, driving, coding, and teaching VEX IQ.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCHOOSING RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY\n\nVEX IQ Platform is designed to offer a wealth of teacher resources [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/iq/viqc-virtual-skills/teachers-portal?lng=en] and curricular support to enable you to infuse coding, 21st century skills, and STEM concepts into your learning space easily, confidently, and creatively. STEM Labs and Activities offer a variety of skill levels and real world connections.\n\nIn addition to a well designed, easy to implement educational program, VEX also offers educational resources at education.vex.com [https://education.vex.com/] that bolsters a smooth learning experience for both teachers and students.\n\n\nCUMULATIVE PACING GUIDE\n\nPacing_Guide.png [/hc/article_attachments/5836607837204/Pacing_Guide.png]\n\nThe Cumulative Pacing Guide for the VEX IQ [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmNfN8X9Trpr8UhcZAGPa-akSaPDrFxsoluerQ0AMQk/edit#gid=277290212] platform shows potential sequences and connections between STEM Lab Units and various subject areas. \n\n\nCONTENT STANDARDS\n\nContent_Standards.png [/hc/article_attachments/5836886606868/Content_Standards.png]\n\nThe Content Standards [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046896951-Content-Standards-Standards-for-VEX-IQ] and Where and How the Standards are Reached [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046447512-Where-and-How-the-Standards-are-Reached-Standards-for-VEX-IQ] documents demonstrate how various activities align with each STEM Lab Unit. These standards include NGSS, CSTA, and ISTE, as well as state standards such as Common Core and TEKS to name a few.\n\n\nBUILD VIDEO (2ND GENERATION)\n\nimage7.png [/hc/article_attachments/5916236967444/image7.png]\n\nIn the Teacher Portal for each 2nd generation STEM Lab is the Building Your First Robot video. This video walks through how to build the BaseBot step by step following the build instructions [http://link.vex.com/iq/builds/basebot/iq-2nd-gen-basebot]. Here is the Teacher Portal from the Tug of War STEM Lab [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/iq/tug-of-war/teachers-portal?lng=en].\n\n\nVEX LIBRARY\n\nVex_Library.png [/hc/article_attachments/5837641209108/Vex_Library.png]\n\nThe VEX Library [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002324792-IQ] is a library of information about all things VEX. The purpose of the VEX Library is to help VEX users quickly find information about VEX products, services, or topics. The VEX Library offers self-service support content around multiple topics and themes.\n\n\nVEX CAMPS\n\nCamp.png [/hc/article_attachments/5836302084628/Camp.png]\n\nSTEM Labs and Activities do not need to be limited to a traditional classroom setting. VEX Camps [https://camps.vex.com/] can be offered all year around, from summer enrichment or fall fundraisers to winter break offerings or spring family fun days. This option is great if you want to provide students or community members with an extra way to get involved with engineering and coding in a fun and engaging way.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSUGGESTED PLANNING STRATEGIES\n\nThe VEX IQ platform can be well executed in a variety of ways, thus making it a valuable tool in a variety of learning environments. These highly engaging STEM materials give it a significant role in the success of a school and its students and teachers.\n\nConsider the following as you plan to implement VEX IQ in your educational space:\n\n * What is your time frame and/or setting? STEM Labs can give you ideas for how to guide students through creating a project or experimenting with a build. Activities can give you ideas for more independent student explorations or challenges. Are there any space constraints that you have that might affect your activities?\n   * Use the VEX IQ Pacing Guide [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmNfN8X9Trpr8UhcZAGPa-akSaPDrFxsoluerQ0AMQk/edit#gid=277290212] to help you plan your curriculum like in the examples below: \n     * If you are teaching a one semester beginner VEX IQ class, you may want to start with the Beginner IQ STEM Labs and corresponding VEX IQ Activities.\n     * If you are teaching a one semester advanced Robotics class, you may want to do a quick refresh of skills by completing a few Activities, and then move into more intermediate/advanced STEM Labs such as Castle Crasher or Clawbot with Controller.\n     * What balance of direct instruction and open-ended or hands-on exploration do you wish to have? Will you give students an Activity to follow on their own, or will you guide them through the experience as a whole group?\n * How will students be introduced to the concept or project? Will you use the setup of a STEM Lab to help you engage students, or will they watch a tutorial video to begin class? What prior experience can you draw on to help your students make a personal connection to the lesson content?\n * How will you wrap up class? Will there be a closing ceremony for the end of the classroom competition? How will students express their voice and choice to share their learning?\n\n\n"

Coding the Bumper Switch in Blocks\n    3. Coding the Bumper Switch in Python\n\nThis sensor is a switch. It tells the robot whether its bumper is pressed (sensor value of 1) or released (sensor value of 0).\n\n[/hc/article_attachments/360042386851/5dc33fbeb5632.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE BUMPER SWITCH WORKS: COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT\n\nThe VEX IQ Bumper Switch is based on probably the most commonly used electrical device: the switch. A switch consists of two terminals (places to attach a wire) and a wire bridge to 'make' the connection when the switch is pressed. As in the illustration, when you press on the connecting wire, you 'complete' the circuit, and the Robot Brain registers that in your program!\n\n\n\nBasically the Bumper Switch is a part of a circuit which is unconnected, or broken. When you press the Bumper Switch, the connection is made, and electricity is allowed to flow.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE BUMPER SWITCH\n\n * This sensor can trigger a robot action when pressed or released.\n * This sensor can be used as a toggle to turn on or off motors when pressed.\n\n\n\n * This sensor can detect walls or objects when the bumper runs into them.\n\n\n\n * The sensor can detect other parts of the robot, such as an arm, when it presses in the bumper.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSES OF THE BUMPER SWITCH ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\n * While in autonomous mode, a Bumper Switch can be used so that your robot will wait to carry out a certain action until it is pressed by some sort of object.\n * The Bumper Switch can detect when it comes into contact with a surface such as a perimeter wall, or an object such as a game piece.\n * Two Bumper Switches can be used, for example on the front and side of the robot, so that the robot can position itself in a corner. Then the robot can more accurately navigate from that corner to other positions on the competition field. \n * You can use a Bumper Switch to have your robot detect when one part of it, such as its arm, comes into contact with another part of it, such as its chassis.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING THE BUMPER SWITCH IN VEXCODE IQ\n\n\nADDING THE BUMPER SWITCH AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nScreenshot_2023-03-01_at_9.16.54_AM.png [/hc/article_attachments/13585330690836]\n\nTo code the Bumper Switch in a VEXcode IQ, you must first configure the Bumper Switch.

    "content": "CLASSROOM DOCUMENTATION WITH VEX 123\nThe walls of our classroom can be visually engaging, welcoming, colorful, and informative places. They can also be celebrations of learning, and even hubs of activity where students can actively participate in their evolution as their learning progresses. There are many things that we can share through documentation on our bulletin boards and walls, but when we think about what the real purpose of that documentation is, it likely boils down to a few main ideas:\n\n * Create a classroom environment that is a welcoming space reflective of who is in it\n * Make student learning visible to students and stakeholders (parents, administrators, visitors to our classroom)\n * Foster student learning by providing a tangible way to learn from ourselves and others\n\nIt may seem at first like these are fairly lofty goals for a classroom bulletin board. No matter how crafty or thematic we make our walls, in many instances, they are a passive part of the environment. Sometimes this is what is needed, but other times, we can leverage documentation to support student learning and agency.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION AS DISPLAY\n\nMaking the learning in our classroom visible to students and stakeholders is important. When my principal entered my classroom, I wanted her to know immediately what kinds of projects we were working on. Students want to have a way to share their work with parents when they visit. Displays are a great way to do that, as they tell a story of learning that has occurred. For instance…\n\nVEX 123 Dragon in the Village bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/documentation-as-display.png]\n\nHere we have a visually appealing memory of the Dragon in the Village Activity Series. There are images of the children working, artifacts from their coding using printables and photos, and words of the students self-describing something they learned. A visitor to the classroom could see that students were using a 123 Robot, and they would be able to see how engaged they were and what they had done to code the robot. Students can see themselves reflected here, and have a recap of what they did during this project.\n\nThe presentation itself is very teacher driven, and while the voice of the student is there in some ways, it is presented through the eyes and perspective of the teacher. This is showing a finished product, rather than an evolution. While this communicates something about student learning and creates a welcoming space, it doesn’t necessarily propel learning further.\n\n\nLIVING DOCUMENTATION\n\nA ‘living’ piece of documentation grows and evolves as student learning grows and evolves. Typically, it starts simply, leaving visual and physical space for artifacts and traces of student learning. This style of documentation eases the ‘setup’ burden on the teacher, and is generally done at the start of a project, rather than the end. For instance…\n\nguiding questions bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/living-documentation.png]\n\nHere we can see many similar items, yet the presentation is shifted. Instead of presenting the product of students’ learning, the evolution of the process of their learning is here. We can see what ‘big ideas’ have been agreed upon, what students are trying to figure out, and the materials they are using to be able to do so. There are additional items, like students’ journal pages, teacher’s recorded conversations, and saved project collections that can help prompt students to see how their thinking has changed, by giving them tangible reminders of what they previously thought through these artifacts.\n\nThe presentation, while clearly organized by the teacher, is accessible to students and has components that they can interact with, like the project archive, printables, and activities. The balance of voice between student and teacher is more balanced.\n\nThis space is welcoming, reflective of learning, and begins to foster learning by giving students a physical space to revisit their previous knowledge, and a physical space to show what they are currently learning and working through.\n\n\nINTERACTIVE DOCUMENTATION\n\nLike living documentation, the space grows and evolves. However, with interactive documentation, the students are the ones that are primarily contributing to the space. Interactive documentation can be used to have students share progress over a longer term investigation or project, but (particularly for younger students) it is often used for smaller, more focused parts of a project. For instance…\n\nprogress bulletin board [/sites/default/files/inline-images/interactive-documentation.png]\n\nHere we can see that the ‘setup’ is very simple, and almost like a learning center. The guiding question for the space is open-ended, and one that will allow for a variety of student responses, as there isn’t just ‘one’ right answer. The goal of this space is to show active student learning – to create a hub where students can learn from each other as much as from their own experience.\n\nLearning is documented and shared through the voice and perspective of the students themselves. This is a space that they add to, interact with, take tips and tricks from (physically and cognitively), and their answers evolve over time. When the ‘tips’ are no longer needed, (as determined by students and teachers together) they can be archived to make room for more pressing tips and tricks. This kind of documentation might be part of a larger bulletin board, or just a functional small piece on its own. Either way, once students learn how to interact with it, it is essentially their space to use.\n\nWhen we think about the walls of our classrooms, many things come to mind – they are probably filled with images, charts, reminders, rules, and student work. We want our classrooms to be places that students are happy to be in, where they feel welcome, and where they see themselves reflected. The walls of our classrooms will reflect the action of the community within it, and hopefully the learning that is taking place as well. Creating spaces that feel welcoming, make learning visible, and foster student problem solving and deepening understanding is not a simple task, but it is one that can be incredibly rewarding and valuable. The walls of our classrooms don’t need to be just a passive backdrop, they can themselves be an active part of the learning environment.\n"

    "content": "DESCRIPTION OF THE SENSOR\n\nThe IQ Optical Sensor is a combination of the following sensors:\n\n * Ambient light sensor: Reports the current amount of ambient light that the sensor is detecting. This could be the brightness levels a room, or the brightness of a particular object.\n * Color sensor: Color information is available as RGB (Red, Green, Blue), hue and saturation, or grayscale. Color detection works best when the object is closer than 100 millimeters (mm).\n * Proximity sensor: The proximity sensor measures reflected IR (infrared) energy sourced from an integrated IR LED. As such, the values will change with ambient light and object reflectivity.\n\nIQ_Optical_Sensor-LED_On.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407236334740/IQ_Optical_Sensor-LED_On.png]\n\nThe Optical Sensor also contains white LEDs.\n\nThese LEDs can be turned on and off, or set to a specific percentage of brightness.\n\nThis provides a consistent light source when detecting colors regardless of the surrounding light conditions.\n\nIQ_Optical_Sensor_Mounting.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407236686740/IQ_Optical_Sensor_Mounting.png]\n\nThe back of the sensor's housing has five holes to provide flexibility when mounting the sensor to a robot.\n\nIQ_Optical_Sensor-WindowCallout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407236454804/IQ_Optical_Sensor-WindowCallout.png]\n\nOn the face of the sensor there is a small window where the Optical Sensors are located.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Brain_Connected_to_Optical_Sensor.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407241277076/IQ_Gen_2_Brain_Connected_to_Optical_Sensor.png]\n\nIn order for the Optical Sensor to be functional with the IQ Brain, the sensor’s Smart Port and an IQ Brain’s Smart Port need to be connected with a Smart Cable.\n\nThe Optical Sensor will work with any of the 12 Smart Ports on the IQ Brain.\n\nWhen connecting an IQ Smart Cable to the ports, be sure the cable’s connector is fully inserted into the port and the connector’s locking tab is fully engaged.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW THE OPTICAL SENSOR WORKS\n\nThe IQ Optical Sensor receives light energy and converts the energy into electrical signals. The sensor's internal electronics (a hardware state machine) converts these signals into output signals to be received as an input by the IQ Brain.\n\nAs previously mentioned:\n\n * The sensor’s color detection works best when the object is closer than 100 millimeters (mm) or approximately 3.9 inches.\n * The proximity sensor measures reflected lR light intensity. This will cause the values to change with ambient light and object reflectivity.\n\nThe Optical Sensor needs to be paired with the VEXcode IQ to create a user program for the IQ Brain to utilize the sensor’s readings to control the robot’s behavior.\n\n * See this page to download VEXcode IQ. [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download]\n\nThe IQ Brain in concert with a user program can be used with the Optical Sensor to:\n\n * Turn the sensor’s white LED lights on or off.\n * Set the white LED lights' percentage of power.\n * Detect an object.\n * Detect a color.\n * Measure the percent brightness of ambient light.\n * Measure the hue of a color in degrees.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP OF THE OPTICAL SENSOR\n\n\nPLACEMENT\n\nTH_Lesson_3_Tile__1_.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407236469140/TH_Lesson_3_Tile__1_.png]\n\nThe placement of the Optical Sensor is very important to obtaining accurate readings.\n\nBe sure no structure on the robot is in front of the small Optical Sensor window on the face of the sensor.\n\nThere needs to be a clear path in front of the sensor between any object being measured and the sensor.\n\n\nREADING OPTICAL SENSOR VALUES\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Brain_-On-OpticalMenu.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407240729620/IQ_Gen_2_Brain_-On-OpticalMenu.png]\n\nIt is helpful to use the Devices screen on the IQ Brain to see the information the Optical Sensor is reporting.\n\n * LED: the current brightness percentage of the LEDs. 0 is off, and 100% is fully on.\n * BRT: the percentage of brightness of the ambient light in the room, or of an object\n * PROX: the proximity of an object as near or far\n * Hue: a hue value between 0 - 359 degrees. Each hue value has a color shade association.\n   \n   To use the Sensor Dashboard, follow the steps in this article.  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407061189908-Using-the-Sensor-Dashboard-on-the-VEX-IQ-2nd-gen-Brain]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING THE OPTICAL SENSOR AS A DEVICE IN VEXCODE IQ\n\nWhenever a sensor is used with a programming language, it needs to be configured within that language. \n\nDevices_-_optical_sensor.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407236931348/Devices_-_optical_sensor.png]\n\nWith VEXcode IQ, this is accomplished by using the ‘Add a device’ feature from the Devices window.\n\nTo add the Optical Sensor to the configuration, follow the steps in this article.  [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035591252-Configuring-Sensors-in-VEXcode-IQ]\n\nOptical_blocks.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407241239572/Optical_blocks.png]\n\nOnce the Optical Sensor has been added to your project, a new set of sensor blocks will become available.\n\nFor more information on the blocks from the ‘Sensing’ category pertaining to the Optical Sensor, view the Help information (Blocks project [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035592352-Accessing-Help-in-a-VEXcode-IQ-Blocks-Project] or C++ project [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046955671-Accessing-Help-in-a-VEXcode-IQ-C-Project]).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON USES OF THE OPTICAL SENSOR\n\nThe Optical Sensor can produce several measurements which can be used to change the behavior of the robot. These features include:\n\n\nDETECT AN OBJECT\n\nDetect_an_object.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407238702356/Detect_an_object.png]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to detect an object when it becomes within the range of the Optical Sensor.\n\nThe example project shown on the left is used to code a robot with an Optical Sensor mounted on the front to drive until it detects an object, such as a cube, and then stop driving once the object is detected by the Optical Sensor.\n\n\nDETECT A COLOR\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Simple_Clawbot_with_Cubes-OpticalCallout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407240759572/IQ_Gen_2_Simple_Clawbot_with_Cubes-OpticalCallout.png]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to identify the color of an object.\n\nAn example could be to code a robot with an Optical Sensor mounted on the front and a Touch LED attached to turn until it detects an object, such as a colored cube.\n\nOnce an object is detected, the robot stops turning for 5 seconds and glows the Touch LED the color of the object detected.\n\n\nMEASURE AMBIENT LIGHT\n\nAmbient_light.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407248982932/Ambient_light.png]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to measure the brightness of the light around it.\n\nThe example project shown on the left is used to drive a robot in a circle when the lights in a room are turned on, and stop the robot from driving when the lights are turned off.\n\n\nMEASURE THE HUE VALUE\n\nvex-rainbow-circle-graphic_2.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/4407234786068/vex-rainbow-circle-graphic_2.jpg]\n\nThis feature allows your robot to provide a number for the hue of color of an object.\n\nThe Optical Sensor reports the corresponding hue value in degrees from 0 to 359 based on the color wheel to the left.\n\nThis provides a more precise measurement of color as compared to a generalized red, green, or blue designation.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nUSES OF THE OPTICAL SENSOR ON A COMPETITION ROBOT\n\nThe Optical Sensor will provide an excellent competitive advantage for competition robots. The ability to detect objects and their color will provide a great deal of information when designing autonomous routines. An object’s presence and hue of color will provide helpful information with the detection of game pieces and or goals.\n\nIQ_Gen_2_Fling_-OpticalCallout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4407249790484/IQ_Gen_2_Fling_-OpticalCallout.png]\n\nFor example, in the 2021 - 2022 VEX IQ Challenge, Pitching In, an Optical sensor could be angled to scan your robot's intake.\n\nAs soon as a ball is detected in the intake, this could automatically turn on the robot's arm to launch the ball.\n\nNo matter what the application the VEX IQ Optical Sensor is used for, there is no doubt it will be a welcomed addition for teams.\n\nThe function of the sensor’s values are open for the imagination of the user.\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: February 21, 2022\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Using+the+IQ+Optical+Sensor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407229044500-Using-the-IQ-Optical-Sensor]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Using+the+IQ+Optical+Sensor&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407229044500-Using-the-IQ-Optical-Sensor]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Using+the+IQ+Optical+Sensor&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F4407229044500-Using-the-IQ-Optical-Sensor]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.

    "content": "USING THE PACING GUIDE IN VEX 123 STEM LABS\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. The Pacing Guide\n 2. Adapting this Unit to Your Classroom\n 3. Tying it All Together - Sara’s Story\n\nThe Pacing Guide, located in the Unit Overview of each 123 STEM Lab Unit, offers information about the learning activities in each STEM Lab in that Unit, as well as support materials for teachers. The Pacing Guide has two main components - an overview of the Labs, and strategies to help teachers meet various implementation challenges they may encounter.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE PACING GUIDE\n\nEach Lab in the Unit is broken down to give a preview of the concepts and activities taught throughout the Lab. See how the learning activities are introduced, taught, and shared through the Engage, Play, and Share sections of the Labs.\n\nThis information is useful for previewing a Unit at a glance to see what it will cover, and how, as well as the materials needed for each Lab.\n\nPacing_Guide_overview_section.png [/hc/article_attachments/360082496211/Pacing_Guide_overview_section.png]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nADAPTING THIS UNIT TO YOUR CLASSROOM\n\nThe “Adapting this Unit to Your Classroom” section offers targeted recommendations and suggestions for how to amend and adapt the 123 STEM Lab Unit to support various challenges or situations that can arise. This guidance is designed to help teachers feel supported in every aspect of teaching STEM Labs in their classrooms, both in the best of circumstances, and especially in the moments when the best laid plans simply don’t work out. STEM Lab Units can be adapted to meet those changing needs when they arise. The challenges addressed in this section offer guidance for situations like needing to implement a Unit in less time, as well as strategies for reteaching and extending the Unit to support differentiation or asynchronous implementation.\n\n * Implementing in Less Time - Offers ways to condense the learning activities of the STEM Labs in the Unit to be able to meet the same learning goals in less time. Whether combining parts of Play, or replacing an Active Share activity with a brief conversation, this section will offer ways to keep your STEM Lab curriculum on track, even if you’ve lost class time.\n\n * Activities to Support Reteaching - Offers guidance and specific activities to support reteaching in a variety of situations. With context for the extra practice desired, 123 Activities that align to the Unit are linked with a brief descriptor of the connection, to make reteaching as easy as possible.\n\n * Extending this Unit - Offers ways to extend the learning of the Unit beyond the activities of the STEM Labs. From curricular extensions, to Choice Board activities, teachers are offered ways to extend the Unit through whole class instruction, or small group work.\n\nAdapting_this_Unit_to_your_classroom_section.png [/hc/article_attachments/360082496191/Adapting_this_Unit_to_your_classroom_section.png]\n\nVEX 123 STEM Labs are designed with teachers in mind, and the resources in the VEX 123 platform seek to support teachers as they bring coding concepts to life in any classroom, for any student, and in any implementation scenario.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nTYING IT ALL TOGETHER - SARA’S STORY\n\nSara is a Kindergarten teacher whose classroom is a bustling hub of activity each day. Her teaching style is firmly rooted in learning through play, and as such, her classroom spaces and Learning Centers lend themselves to hands-on activities. Over the years, Sara has been actively incorporating more unplugged coding and computer science related activities into her curriculum. This year, Sara added VEX 123 to her classroom, to bring those coding concepts to life in a different way. Her students quickly adopted the 123 Robots into their classroom community, and Sara has eagerly seized the opportunity to engage in longer term investigations with the 123 STEM Lab Units.\n\nsara-kindergarden-123-activity.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360084755491/sara-kindergarden-123-activity.jpg]\n\nHowever, in the midst of working through the Role Play Robot Unit, a stomach bug spread in Sara’s class, and each day different students were home sick. Sara turned to the Pacing Guide for the Unit, to get ideas for how to keep her whole class engaged and on track, and found the “Activities to support reteaching” were ideal for her situation. The Pacing Guide linked two Activities, so Sara set up one in her 123 Learning Center for the week. Upon returning from being home sick, she made sure each student worked on that Activity during their Morning Center Time. She used the second Activity as a whole class instructional moment, pausing the STEM Lab, to work in this additional lesson. This gave Sara the opportunity to keep the whole class connected to the ideas and concepts of the STEM Lab, despite their varying attendance. The class not only sustained their momentum, but actually got more excited about coding monsters and pets to have emotion codes, in addition to coding their own feelings in the STEM Lab!\n\n "

    "content": "\nWHY DO STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO LEARN FRACTIONS?\n\nBy Lauren Harter\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n\n\n\nIf anyone asked me, which mathematical concept do you think is the hardest for students to learn? Other than maybe any of the concepts taught in real analysis, I would absolutely say fractions.\n\nboard [/sites/default/files/inline-images/AdobeStock_132373580.jpeg]\n\nFractions are crucial in mathematics. They show up in many mathematical relationships like rational numbers, ratios, percentages, probability, and more [1][2]. Also, understanding and learning fractions is one of the core concepts of pre-algebra and algebra.\n\nThe concept of fractions, and operations with fractions, is among one of the most difficult concepts for students to understand. Even when I taught high school mathematics to students with varying ranges of ability, I found that no matter what, I always had to pause and review fractions. \n\nFractions are considered multifaceted. What does that mean? It means there are different conceptual meanings of fractions: ratio; operator; quotient; and measure 3. Understanding fractions as part of a whole is interwoven throughout these four categories.\n\n * A ratio is a comparison between two numbers, such as two programmers for every three engineers in a robotics team. The ratio is 2:3, where the programmers represent ⅖ and the engineers represent ⅗.\n * A fractional operator essentially scales the value (decreases it or enlarges it). For example, ¼ of a number can be the function of multiplying that number by 1, and then dividing it by 4.\n * A quotient is essentially division. ¾ is three divided by four.\n * Measurement is describing the measurement of an interval. This can really be understood better when you think about the interval between 0-1, and how fractions make up everything in between this interval. \n\nstock image [/sites/default/files/inline-images/AdobeStock_418077895.png]\n\nBecause teachers more often than not teach fractions only by memorization (to divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal), instead of ensuring students fully understand these different conceptual meanings, students become stuck in misconceptions, such as \n\n * Students think that the numerator and denominator of the fraction are two completely different numbers (that they are unrelated).\n * Students think that fractional operations should be handled just like any other number. For example, 1+1=2, and with that same logic, add straight across the numerator and denominator 12+12=24 (which we know is incorrect).\n\nIn light of all this, it is easy to see why students find fractions so difficult to understand. They are significantly more complex than 1+1- 2. They have more conceptual meaning and can be very difficult to show concretely. \n\nVEX provides different activities, STEM Labs, and videos to help students practice learning with fractions in ways that emphasize those difficult to grasp abstract concepts. Ideas for Incorporating VEXcode VR into Math Classrooms [https://pd.vex.com/videos/ideas-for-incorporating-vexcode-vr-into-math-classes] is a video that provides ideas and support for using VEXcode VR to supplement math learning in the classroom including fractions and more. \n\nThe Color in Fractions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ed2NHZRDcQPynYCthlorzmyIYuqL5_J1NIf7hiC5J2U/edit?usp=sharing] VEXcode VR activity gives students the chance to use their understanding of fractions as parts of a whole to practice coding.

    "content": "\nCOMPARE THE 1ST AND 2ND GENERATIONS OF VEX\n\n+\nHow much changed in the 2nd generation of VEX IQ?\nSTEM education has evolved since the introduction of VEX IQ in 2013, and the robot construction system needed to evolve as well. The VEX engineers have made hundreds of minor improvements to the VEX IQ system, however, it is still the IQ system you know today, and it is all forwards and backwards compatible. We worked closely with STEM educators and mentors, and we’ve taken their feedback into account in this redesign as well. Advancements in silicon chipsets and battery technologies have also allowed for the integration of new features and capabilities in our robotics platform. A few of these include:\n\n\n * Code with Python, Blocks and C++\n   \n   \n * Educators can easily bring the excitement of VEX competitions into the classroom\n   \n   \n * Classroom clutter is greatly reduced with organized parts storage\n   \n   \n * Student’s robot build experience is enhanced with many new and useful parts\n   \n   \n * Firmware updates are simpler and easier to manage\n   \n   \n * Battery runtime was increased significantly before the robots slow down\n   \n   \n * Compare the VEX IQ Electronics generations [/iq/products/kits-bundles/gen2-comparison]\n\n\nCLASSROOM-SPECIFIC FAQS\n\n+\nAre the parts in the VEX IQ Education Kit (2nd generation) different from the VEX IQ Super Kit (1st generation)?\nYes. The 2nd generation kit has a new collection of parts. This was done to support new STEM Labs and STEM Games with new robot builds. New parts were added that allow for more build options. Some parts were replaced with improved versions. Part quantities have also been adjusted.\n\nSee the IQ Education Kit of Parts [https://link.vex.com/docs/pdf/iq-gen-2-education] and the IQ Competition Kit of Parts [https://link.vex.com/docs/pdf/iq-gen-2-competition]\n+\nWhy was 2nd generation VEX IQ released now?\nThe original plan was to release the 2nd generation of IQ next year after the end of the 2021-2022 competition season. However, global semiconductor shortages made the 1st generation system no longer possible to build in any reasonable timeframe. Our only option was to release the 2nd generation system now, as we can get the semiconductor parts for it.\n+\nWill there be a trade-in program?\nNo. There will not be a trade-in program for IQ 2nd generation.\n+\nWhat should I buy?\nThe VEX IQ Education Kits [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-8899.html] and Bundles [https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq-bundles.html] (2nd generation) are recommended for all new classrooms. Existing classrooms can mix 1st and 2nd generation kits.\n+\nCan I mix generations in the same classroom?\nYes. All of the 2nd generation electronics are compatible with the original 1st generation electronics and vice-versa. This was done to ensure classrooms with mixed 1st and 2nd generation equipment would not have any compatibility issues. Brains, Controllers, Sensors, Motors, and Batteries can be mixed in any combination between 1st and 2nd generation of IQ. The only difference in the generations is that the 2nd generation battery has a new charger. The 2nd generation battery will not charge with the 1st generation charger, and accidentally inserting the 2nd generation battery into a 1st generation charger will not cause any damage either.\n+\nCan I use the old curriculum?\nA new generation of STEM Labs will be available by Fall 2021; however, the development team is working to provide guidance for using all IQ STEM Labs with either the IQ 1st generation or IQ 2nd generation hardware.\n\n\nGENERAL FAQS\n\n+\nHow are the VEX IQ 1st and 2nd generations compatible?\n * Everything works with everything (except chargers)\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with both IQ Robot Batteries (1st and 2nd)\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with both IQ Controllers (1st and 2nd)\n * IQ Robot Brains (1st and 2nd) work with all IQ Sensors and the Smart Motor.\n * The 1st and 2nd generation batteries use different chargers. The 1st generation Battery Chargers will not harm or charge the 2nd generation batteries. The 2nd generation charger connects via USB-C.\n\n+\nCan I still code with VEXcode?\nYes. You can now use VEXcode [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode] for Python, along with Blocks and C++.\n+\nCan I still code with ROBOTC?\nNo. ROBOTC could not be upgraded to the newer technology in IQ Robot Brain (2nd Generation). Users will need to use VEXcode. Learn more about VEXcode. [https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode]\n+\nDo I still need to use the IQ VEXos Utility?\nNo. VEXcode for Windows, Mac, and ChromeOS performs all firmware updates. Additionally, the IQ Robot Brain (2nd generation) does automatic firmware updates to all connected devices at any time, without the need to reconnect to a computer. Simply update the Robot Brain and all other components will automatically be updated, even if they are connected at a later time. The IQ VEXos Utility will continue to be available for the IQ Robot Brain (1st generation).\n+\nHow has the gyroscope sensor been improved over the original Gyro Sensor?\nThe gyro in the 2nd generation is now located inside the Robot Brain. It now has a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. The original Gyro only has a 1-axis gyroscope. Also, the gyro in the 2nd generation Robot Brain drifts significantly less while providing better heading accuracy over time.\n+\nHow has the Distance Sensor in the 2nd generation kit improved over the original Ultrasonic Rangefinder?\nThe new Distance Sensors use a safe Class 1 laser, providing accurate distance measurements. Users will find the new Distance Sensor much more repeatable due to its very narrow measurement beam.\n+\nHow has the Optical Sensor in the 2nd generation kit improved over the original Color Sensor?\nThe new Optical Sensor has better performance in low light conditions and can now detect gestures.\n\n\n\nCOMPETITION-SPECIFIC FAQS\n\n+\nDoes the IQ Robot Brain (2nd generation) provide a competitive advantage?\nYes and No. The processor, RAM, and flash have been improved considerably allowing programs to run faster. However, the communication speed to all the motors and sensors has not increased. For most applications, no competitive advantage exists.\n+\nWill I be able to compete with the 1st generation of IQ?\nYes. Both 1st and 2nd generation VEX IQ parts are permitted in the VEX IQ Challenge.\n+\nAre the motors in the 2nd generation kits more powerful?\nNo. 1st and 2nd generation kits use the same motors.\n+\nDoes the Robot Battery (2nd generation) provide a competitive advantage?\nYes and No.\n * 2nd generation batteries uses Lithium-ion cells\n * 2nd generation batteries will operate five times longer without experiencing any performance loss.\n * 1st generation batteries suffer from voltage drop over time\n * 1st generation batteries can experience performance loss near the end of the match.\n\n\n"

Similar to the calibrate option in the sensor dashboard, the heading can be set while the project is being run using the [Set drive heading] block, set_heading Python command, or setHeading C++ command.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nROTATION\n\nheading_270__rotation_-90.png [/hc/article_attachments/4409698513172/heading_270__rotation_-90.png]\n\nRotation is reported when the robot spins around the center axis of the Brain. The amount of degrees reported on the sensor dashboard indicates the direction of the turn and the degree value of the turns the Brain has completed since calibration. Unlike heading, the numeric values are not limited to the 0-359.99 degrees. The robot can rotate counter-clockwise for a negative value or clockwise for a positive value and will continue to increase the degree value to match the number of rotations the Inertial Sensor within the Brain reports. \n\nrotation_callout.png [/hc/article_attachments/4409682361108/rotation_callout.png]\n\nIn the sensor dashboard on the Brain's screen, rotation is the second value listed.

Deciding on which component to use: Gears, Sprockets, or Pulleys\n\nAs new users begin to assemble their own custom robot designs they may at some point want more from their VEX IQ Smart motors. The VEX IQ Smart Motors have perhaps the best performance and sensing of any snap-together robotic system available. Nonetheless, users could want the motors to move things faster, lift heavier things, or move mechanisms far away from the motor. VEX IQ Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys can allow these requirements to happen.\n\nGears Sprockets Pulleys 228-3502-rev2.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049025451/228-3502-rev2.jpg] 228-2534.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048892552/228-2534.jpg] 228-3508.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049025491/228-3508.jpg]\n\n\nOUTPUT/INPUT RATIOS\n\nWhen discussing the VEX Plastic Gears/Sprockets/Pulleys there are some standard terms which are used:\n\n * Driving/Input - This is the Gear/Sprocket/Pulley placed on the shaft a Smart Motor is forcing to spin.\n * Driven/Output - This is the Gear/Sprocket/Pulley placed on the shaft of the component (such as a wheel or an arm) which will be forced to spin from the input.\n * Rotational Speed - This is how fast a shaft is spinning, commonly measured in how many times it spins in one minute, also known as, revolutions per minute (rpm).\n * Torque - This is the amount of force needed to rotate a load at a distance. For example, it takes more torque to rotate a longer arm or when there is more weight placed on the arm. It also takes more torque to rotate a larger diameter wheel, or when a wheel is moving something heavy. Torque is commonly measured in the metric unit which combines force and distance call the newton-meter (Nm).\n\nThere are two principles which will help users understand how to use VEX Plastic Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys:\n\nIncreased Torque: When the input Gear/Sprocket/Pulley (component) has a smaller diameter than the output component, this will increase the output torque of the system. However, it will proportionally decrease the output rotational speed of the system. In other words, if the motor can not lift an arm, the motor needs to have a smaller component driving a larger component on the arm’s shaft.\n\nGear Increase Torque Sprocket Increase Torque Pulley Increase Torque IQ_Increase_Torque-Gear.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086792/IQ_Increase_Torque-Gear.png] IQ_Increase_Torque-Sprocket.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086812/IQ_Increase_Torque-Sprocket.png] IQ_Increase_Torque-Pulley.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049212211/IQ_Increase_Torque-Pulley.png]\n\nIncreased Speed: When the input component has a larger diameter than the output component, this will increase the output rotational speed of the system. However, it will proportionally decrease the output torque of the system. For example, if a user wants a wheel to spin faster than the motor can spin, the motor needs to have a larger component driving a smaller component on the wheel’s shaft.\n\nGear Increase Speed Sprocket Increase Speed Pulley Increase Speed IQ_Increase_Speed-Gear.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086752/IQ_Increase_Speed-Gear.png] IQ_Increase_Speed-Sprocket.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049086772/IQ_Increase_Speed-Sprocket.png] IQ_Increase_Speed-Pulley.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049212191/IQ_Increase_Speed-Pulley.png]\n\nThe amount of these relationships can be calculated by an output/input ratio. This is:\n\n * The number of output gear teeth / the number of input gear teeth yields the torque gear ratio.\n * The number of output sprocket teeth / the number of input sprocket teeth yields the torque sprocket ratio.\n * The diameter of the output pulley / the diameter of the input pulley yields the torque pulley ratio.\n\nchrome_Z0yvKW0Svc.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049036071/chrome_Z0yvKW0Svc.png]\n\n \n\n\nVEX PLASTIC GEAR RATIOS ( 60 TEETH, 36 TEETH, 12 TEETH)\n\nOutput Gear Input Gear Gear Ratio Output for 100 RPM Motor Input Output for 0.4 Nm Motor Input 60 teeth 12 teeth 5:1 20 rpm 2.0 Nm 36 teeth 12 teeth 3:1 33 rpm 1.2 Nm 60 teeth 36 teeth 5:3 60 rpm 0.67 Nm 36 teeth 60 teeth 3:5 167 rpm 0.24 Nm 12 teeth 36 teeth 1:3 300 rpm 0.13 Nm 12 teeth 60 teeth 1:5 500 rpm 0.08 Nm\n\n(24 tooth and 48 tooth gears are available in an add-on pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/24-48-tooth-gear-pack.html])\n\n \n\nFrom the VEX Plastic Gear Ratio chart above it should be apparent that ratios can dramatically change the amount of output rotational speed and output torque of a Smart Motor. It is important to realize when using output/input ratios these do not take into account friction and other factors in the robot’s system.\n\nFor instance, it might be tempting to build a 1:5 gear ratio for the drivetrain so the robot will move very fast (500 rpm). There are several factors which make this impractical. First, the 60 teeth gears are larger than the standard 200mm Travel Wheels so the gear will hold the wheel off the ground. In addition, the output torque will be so small (0.08 Nm) the Smart Motor may not be able to move the wheel/robot. Even if it were possible to use this ratio, if the robot were to move at five times its normal speed it would be very difficult to control.\n\nThis example illustrates how when using output/input ratios the objective is to find a “sweet spot” balance between torque and speed. It is also important to make sure the components will fit into the robot’s design.\n\nVEX Plastic Sprockets have five different sizes of Sprockets (8 Tooth Sprocket, 16 Tooth Sprocket, 24 Tooth Sprocket, 32 Tooth Sprocket, 40 Tooth Sprocket) which can be combined. The VEX Plastic Pulleys have four available sizes (10mm, 20mm, 30mm, 40mm).\n\n\nPOWER TRANSFER\n\nVEX Plastic Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys may also be used for power transfer. This is needed when a design does not allow a Smart Motor to directly drive the shaft of a wheel or other component. In this case, the input and output Gears/Sprockets/Pulleys will be the same size so there is no change to the torque or the rotational speed. This is often called an 1:1 ratio.\n\nSome examples of this might include:\n\n * A drivetrain can power both wheels on a side by direct driving one wheel with a Smart Motor and power the other wheel by connecting them together with 1:1 Sprockets and Chain.\n * A drivetrain can have 3 gears (or any other odd-number) in a series and have a wheel attached to the first gear and a wheel attached to the last gear. If all the gears are the same size, the motor can drive any one of the gears.\n\nPlease note when using gears within a drivetrain it is important to have an odd number of gears between the wheels. This is because when one gear drives another, they rotate in opposite directions. An even number of gears between wheels will have the two wheels turning against one another.\n\n\n\nPower Transfer Sprockets Power Transfer Gears PowerTransfer-Sprocket.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048900932/PowerTransfer-Sprocket.jpg] IQ_Standard_Drivebase__2_.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049033631/IQ_Standard_Drivebase__2_.png]\n\n\nDECIDING ON WHICH COMPONENT TO USE: GEARS, SPROCKETS, OR PULLEYS\n\nThere are a number of factors which determine whether Gears, Sprockets. or Pulleys should be used with a robot design. Some of these include:\n\nGears: Gears are one of the most reliable of the three choices of components. Unless there is too large a span between the supports of the gear shafts allowing the shafts to flex enough for the two gears’ teeth to separate; with gears, when the input gear spins, the output gear will spin. However there are some drawbacks:\n\n * Gears have to be arranged at fixed distances from one another so the teeth of one gear intermesh with the teeth of the next.\n * Gears need to be aligned in a straight line to one another. (Noted exception: to mix \"Primary\" 12/36/50 tooth gears with the \"Secondary\" 24/48 gears. The secondary gears need to be either offset by half a pitch, or need to use the extra middle hole in even-length 1x Beams).\n * As mentioned before, an odd number of gears in a line will have the input and output gears spinning in the same direction, and an even number will have the input/output gears spinning in opposite directions.\n\nMixing \"Primary\" 12/36/60 tooth gears with the \"Secondary\" 24/48 gears\n\nMixing_IQ_Gears.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360049043371/Mixing_IQ_Gears.jpg]\n\nSpecial note: When using a gear ratio, only the input gear size and the last output gear size need to be considered. Any gears in between those two gears only transfer the motion and their sizes have no effect on the gear ratio.\n\nVEX Plastic Gears also have a Crown Gears which will allow for a 90o connection between gears. There are also Worm gears [https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2532.html] and a Differential & Bevel Gear Pack [https://www.vexrobotics.com/differential-and-bevel-gear-pack.html] which allow this.\n\nCrown Gears Differential & Bevel Gears Worm Gears IQ_CrownGear.png [/hc/article_attachments/360049117971/IQ_CrownGear.png] 228-4418-app.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048893892/228-4418-app.jpg] blue.jpg [/hc/article_attachments/360048893872/blue.jpg]\n\nIn addition, VEX Plastic Rack Gears from the Gear Add-on kit will allow for linear motion.\n\nRack Gears IQ_Rack_Gears.png [/hc/article_attachments/360048988072/IQ_Rack_Gears.png]\n\nSprockets: Sprockets are also a good option. Their shafts can be separated at any number of different pitch distances because the chain is assembled from individual snap-together links which can be put together in custom lengths. The input Sprocket and output Sprocket will always be spinning in the same direction. The driving Sprocket should have at least 120o of chain wrapped around it or the chain can skip teeth on the Sprocket. Sprockets can also be connected together with Tank Tread.\n\n\n\nPulleys: Pulleys are intended for light loads. They are limited by the distances they can be separated by the lengths of the available Rubber Belts (30mm. 40mm. 50mm. 60mm).

    "content": "INTERWEAVING MODELING, DOCUMENTATION AND FEEDBACK\n\nBy Aimee DeFoe\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nModeling, feedback and documentation are essential components of effective teaching. When we use them together in deliberate and strategic ways, they become a powerful part of our practice. We can interlace them to help students reflect on both their learning and the learning of others, to inspire new understandings. We can use them to help students learn to communicate more clearly about their ideas and their current understandings as well. And, they can help students to visualize what the next steps in their learning trajectory should be. So what would interweaving modeling, documentation, and feedback look like as students prepare for a classroom competition, such as in an IQ (2nd gen) STEM Lab?\n\nAll of the IQ (2nd gen) STEM Labs provide the kind of rich project work that affords the maximum benefit from interweaving modeling, documentation and feedback. Let’s imagine we are about to begin the IQ (2nd gen) Up and Over STEM Lab  [https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/iq/up-and-over]with students. \n\nGetting Started\n\n * As you go through the process of co-creating learning targets [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/5525737110548-Co-creating-Learning-Targets-with-Your-Students] with your students, select a learning goal or two that you most want to emphasize. Although you are going to create several learning targets, don’t dilute the process by trying to focus your attention on all of them at once! \n\n * Consider selecting one target that is an essential engineering or coding target your students need to focus on, and one that is geared towards building students’ learning capacities. In our Up and Over example, the selected targets could be:\n   * I can design an effective claw for competing in the Up and Over Competition.\n   * I can collaborate with my teammates to create a strategy for the Treasure Hunt Competition.\n\n \n\nModeling \n\n * Now that you have chosen learning targets to focus on, take some time to think thoroughly about exactly what outcomes you want your students to achieve. For example, if you know your students have no experience in designing an effective claw, you may want them to gain the fundamental understanding that before beginning to design, they must consider the size, shape, height, and weight of the object they are designing for. \n\n * Then, after your students have viewed the Claw Design video in Lesson 2, explicitly model the process of thinking about designing for the size, shape, height and weight of the object they are going to move with their claw - the IQ Cube. Pretend you are working on the first iteration of your claw design and narrate the process, thinking aloud about the decisions you are making and why. Make sure to explicitly model considerations about the size, shape, height, and weight of the IQ cube as you go. \n   * Keep in mind that you don’t need to model designing the “perfect” claw! You are modeling a thinking process and not a product. It’s fine to leave room for iteration and improvement.\n\nConnecting Modeling to Documentation\n\n * Additionally, model how you would draw and document your first claw iteration in an Engineering notebook, calling out what you would like to see in their notebooks! If you show your students how to label their drawings to communicate how they consider the size, shape, height, and weight of the IQ cube, they are much more likely to consider this design question fully and make their documentation of this iteration more thorough!\n\n * Think of it this way: If you want to see something in students’ engineering notebooks, be sure they see you modeling it! You can do the same thing with any concept – from coding to competition strategy design. \n\n \n\nstudents collab [/sites/default/files/inline-images/students-together.jpg]\n\nTaking Documentation Further to Inspire Feedback from Teachers and Students\n\n * The engineering notebook can be a fantastic documentation tool and record of student progress over time. But, it can also be a communication catalyst that allows students to provide constructive feedback for one another in an organic way. \n   * Allow time for students to view and discuss each other’s engineering notebooks. They can generate their own questions about other students’ designs, or you can guide them to ask questions about certain aspects of their thinking process (e.g., How and why did you decide to make your claw that size? What made you change your design in that way?)\n   * Consider having students display engineering notebook pages that demonstrate progress towards the understanding you are focusing on. When students display their work in progress, the work becomes a form of communication that can provoke new understandings in other students, and build students' sense of being part of a community of learners. In the essay, “Creativity as a Quality of Thought”, Carlina Rinaldi shares, “Representing our learning process and being able to share with others becomes indispensable for that reflexiveness which generates knowledge.” \n   * Weave more modeling in by demonstrating for students how to provide specific feedback to each other that can help further learning! You can do this explicitly as well as implicitly, by making sure when you are providing feedback you are doing just that.\n\n * Consider having your students create additional forms of documentation they can share with other students and with you to document their learning. For example, using our Up and Over STEM Lab Unit, students could:\n   * Interview each other about how their claw design improved over time as they iterated on a design that takes size, shape, height and weight of the IQ cube they are designing for into account. Share the video and use a jumping-off point for a class discussion.\n   * Use data from the VEX IQ Leaderboard [https://education.vex.com/leaderboard/iq] to create a display that connects that data to specific claw design iterations that shows how they are related. Have other students comment on this display, or use it as part of your Debrief Conversation at the end of the STEM Lab.\n   * Have students write sports journalism inspired articles about their Classroom Competitions, with your desired understanding as a framework. “How Team SuperClaw used Engineering Design to Win it All in the Up and Over Competition!” \n   * The possibilities are endless!\n\nfeedback [/sites/default/files/inline-images/teacher-with-students.png]\n\nUsing Documentation and Feedback to Inspire Next Steps!\n\n * When you give students feedback in the form of suggestions for improving work, make it go further by including examples of how to do this. For example, if you suggest to students that they collect data on how specific elements of their claw design is influencing the outcome of a classroom competition during a debrief conversation, be sure that you explicitly model how this might be done the next time you are working on an engineering concept in a STEM Lab. \n * Use students’ documentation and the feedback they provide to one another to inform your conversation the next time you co-create learning targets with students. (You will have come full circle!)\n\nTaking a big-picture look at how modeling, documentation, and feedback are connected, and how we can employ them strategically to bring out the best in our students academically and socially is definitely worth the time and effort. Although it takes a little planning and energy at the outset, the dividends will pay off as you see your students grow in confidence and settle into a learning community where engaging with their thought processes becomes second nature to themselves and to you as the teacher!\n"

    "content": "LOOKING AT VEX ROBOTICS COMPETITIONS THROUGH THE LENS OF THE HABITS OF MIND\n\nBy Audra Selkowitz\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nThe academic benefits of robotics competitions are easy to see, and are a major motivator for administrators, parents, and teachers to support robotics teams in school. The robot itself, the engineering notebook, and even the code behind the robot are tangible, visible representations of student learning. The STEM connections could not be more clear. However, robotics teams also support students in other areas as well, and these intangible skills, like collaboration, teamwork, and communication are just as important (if not moreso), as the science, technology, engineering, and math they are engaging in. While only some robotics students may go on to STEM related careers, all of our students, whether on robotics teams, or a part of classroom competitions, will have to learn to navigate complex cooperative and collaborative environments in their futures. These life experiences, from college to career to family life, will rely on students’ ability to leverage their social-emotional learning in order to be successful in work and in life.\n\nOne of my favorite ‘organizers’ for thinking about the so-called ‘soft skills’ that lay a foundation for learning are the Habits of Mind. Developed by Costa and Kallick, the Habits of Mind are described as “characteristics of what intelligent people do when they are confronted with problems, the resolutions to which are not immediately apparent.” These 16 characteristics are rarely used in isolation, but instead are interwoven throughout students’ experiences and learning. Depending on the situation, certain Habits of Mind may feature more prominently than others, but rarely is there a case where only one is used by itself. \n\nWe have talked about several of the Habits of Mind in PD+ videos [https://pd.vex.com/videos/playlist/habits-of-mind], Community conversations [https://plc.pd.vex.com/t/documenting-persistence-in-your-classroom/294], and Insights articles [https://pd.vex.com/insights/documenting-persistence]. Some of the Habits, like persistence, have obvious connections to robotics. Yet nothing brought home the holistic nature of the connection between competition robotics and the Habits of Mind like attending the VEX Robotics World Championship last month. \n\nThis graphic from The Habits of Mind Institute outlines the 16 Habits of Mind:\n\nHabits of Mind [/sites/default/files/inline-images/pEW0dfQA0v3O2jmhdVPzDmVr7P3Vu043BLRtsAAa3sH3Z0r87Lc3zAonNQWpch0AS_gp0rTE-hF6E7VKMPYsmbxwHoEGo464eiCchmQ07nxhriq52Rh3EtWnPLTAATYVsXFHNZm_x6wQBQDzWw.jpg]\n\nAfter experiencing VEX Worlds for the first time, one of the many things that struck me, and stayed with me, was how visible the Habits of Mind were throughout the competition. From students practicing in the pits, to championship matches, and everything in between – all of the Habits were so clearly being practiced and fostered throughout the competition. When thinking about how to best describe the ‘intangibles’ and the social emotional learning that was ever present, that Habits of Mind seemed an ideal organizer for my thoughts. \n\nI saw and heard each of the Habits in a number of ways, and I will try to summarize those observations here. For the purposes of this article, I’m choosing one connection for each Habit, though there are many options to choose from\n\nHabit of Mind                                           Description of the Habit                                                                                                                                               In the Context of Competition\nPersistence                                             Stick to it! Persevering in a task through completion; remaining focused; looking for ways to reach your goal when stuck; not giving up.                               This is present in literally every corner and every moment of competition. From the initial robot building through the iterations of design, code, and strategy; to learning from mistakes in matches; to coming back match after match and day after day to make your robot better. \nListening with Understanding and Empathy                Understand others! Devoting mental energy to another person’s thoughts and ideas; making an effort to perceive another’s point of view and emotions.                   When students collaborate on a team successfully, they are able to listen to teammates and attempt to understand where they are coming from. They are able to apply empathy when making decisions or working towards a compromise. They can listen to others and truly hear their ideas in order to build upon them together.\nThinking Flexibly                                       Look at it another way! Being able to change perspectives, generate alternatives, consider options.                                                                    Each time students cycle through the engineering design process, they are applying flexible thinking to iterate on their design, code, or strategy. In identifying a problem, coming up with possible solutions, and testing those solutions, students need to be able to grow, change, and evolve their initial ideas into new iterations.\nThinking and Communicating with Clarity and Precision   Be clear! Striving for accurate communication in both written and oral form; avoiding over- generalizations, distortions, deletions, and exaggerations.                Teams’ engineering notebooks are a visible artifact of this Habit, as they are filled with diagrams, written reflections, and precise project plans. Teams’ planning conversations necessitate precise language to be sure that all team members are on the same page about what they are trying to build, or how they are trying to code or drive their robot.\nCreating, Imagining, and Innovating                     Try a different way! Generating new and novel ideas, fluency, originality.                                                                                             When iterating on a robot design, students need to see the game elements and the robot from a new perspective, to be able to imagine things that do not yet exist. They may begin with a Herobot, but then use their experience with that robot to invent components that optimize its abilities. This takes creativity and the ability to work with constraints to make an idea come to life. \nThinking Interdependently                               Work together! Being able to work with and learn from others in reciprocal situations; working in teams.                                                               The most successful teams demonstrate behaviors of cooperative individuals – like ‘listening, consensus seeking, giving up an idea to work with someone else’s, empathy, compassion, group leadership, knowing how to support group efforts, altruism’. Team members work together towards a common goal, while seeking to genuinely learn from and with one another.\nThinking About Thinking (metacognition)                 Know your knowing! Being aware of your own thoughts, strategies, feelings, and actions, and their effects on others.                                                   Engineering notebooks are one of the most powerful examples of documentation of metacognition I have seen. Students document not only their robot design and competition results, but their reflections, decision making, and thought processes from the start of the season to the end. The visible learning present in an engineering notebook shows the ‘A ha! Moments’, the evolution of an idea, what students did to test it and how they made sense of their results for themselves.\nRemaining Open to Continuous Learning                   I have so much more to learn! Having humility and pride when admitting you don’t know; resisting complacency.                                                          Teams that find an ‘answer’ to a problem or an initial strategy for the game, are motivated to continue to learn – they do not stop, they try to find a better answer or a more effective strategy! Scouting gives great visibility to this Habit, as students look outside of their team to find solutions, to learn more, and to learn from others around them. \nQuestioning and Posing Problems                         How do you know? Having a questioning attitude; knowing what data are needed and developing questioning strategies to produce those data; finding problems to solve.   Students are continually asking and answering questions in order to engage in iterative processes. “Effective problem solvers know how to ask questions to fill in the gaps between what they know and don’t know.” Teams gather data and use that data to make decisions about what will be most effective on their robot design or in their code. During their interviews, they explain how and why they reached those decisions, and the questions they posed, and then answered along the way.\nStriving for Accuracy                                   Check it again! Always doing your best; setting high standards; checking and finding ways to improve constantly.                                                       This Habit is especially present in the coding component of competitions. An autonomous project needs a lot of attention to accuracy, from where the robot is placed, to the measurements or sensor data that is used. And that project must be repeatable, and is continually optimized to make it better, so that they can score more points from match to match. \nTaking Responsible Risks                                Venture out! Being adventuresome; living on the edge of your competence; trying new things constantly.                                                                 The initial stages of robot design and game strategy are all about responsible risks! Teams have to try something in order to see how it works and get a baseline for iteration. From the first ideas that teams have for how to approach a new game, each idea that is offered, actioned, and tested is essentially an exercise in taking responsible risks and learning from the results in order to improve.\nApplying Past Knowledge to New Situations               Use what you learn! Accessing prior knowledge; transferring knowledge beyond the situation in which it was learned.                                                    Not only can teams apply their learning about coding and robotics from year to year, but also their knowledge of what it means to be a good teammate. No matter the game, collaboration and teamwork never go out of style! Veteran team members can mentor rookie members, within and among teams, helping everyone to learn what collaborative strategies can help them be most successful in competition.\nManaging Impulsivity                                    Take your time! Thinking before acting; remaining calm, thoughtful, and deliberate.                                                                                    When faced with a new game, there are so many things that students can do – and if they tried to do all of them, none would be really successful. Teams need to be thoughtful in their approach, so they can make a plan together, and follow through on ideas to see them to fruition. Rather than jumping from robot building to coding to engineering notebook and back again, students take on roles on their team so that they can manage a piece of the puzzle in a deliberate way.\nResponding with Wonderment and Awe                      Have fun figuring it out! Finding the world awesome and mysterious; being intrigued with phenomena and beauty.                                                         There is no question that this is present in competition! Students watch other teams approaches to the game, and are intrigued and visibly awed by robot design and strategy approaches. They are continually having fun in every corner of a competition - from decorating the pits to practicing to connecting with other teams from other schools, or even other countries. Not to mention the game reveal for the new season! \nGathering Data with All Your Senses                     Use your natural pathways! Paying attention to the world around you; gathering data through taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight.                                   Thinking about this Habit in connection to experiential learning and engaged observation brings it to robotics in a meaningful way. To me, this Habit connects to being fully ‘present’ in what you are doing and learning – similar to being in a state of ‘flow’. Walking through the pits and seeing students working on a build iteration, or working through their code, the engagement in their work is incredible.\nFinding Humor                                           Laugh a little! Finding the whimsical, incongruous, and unexpected; being able to laugh at yourself.                                                                   As hard as teams are working, the celebrations, decorations, costumes, swag, and the sheer joy that is present during competition speaks to this Habit. Keeping humor present in what you are doing helps maintain some perspective, which can be so important. And one of the goals of robotics competitions is ultimately to make learning fun! \n\nKids shaking hands [/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-22%20at%202.37.01%20PM.png]\n\nAs much as students are learning about things like drivetrain design, using sensor data to build an algorithm, or how to document their work in an engineering notebook, they are also learning about how to engage with the people and world around them in meaningful ways. Very few, if any, students are going to get a job designing robots that lift mobile goals, or stack cubes. Yet all will have futures that require them to listen to others, to work together, to challenge themselves, to learn more, to not take themselves too seriously, to persevere, to communicate clearly and effectively, to demonstrate empathy, and to find joy in the midst of everything else going on in their lives. These Habits of Mind can be fostered by robotics competitions, and set the stage for valuable, meaningful, lifelong learning.\n\n"

    "content": "UNDERSTANDING ROBOT FEATURES IN VEXCODE VR\n\nIn this article\n\n 1. Robot Controls\n    1. Robot Physical Attributes\n 2. Robot Sensors\n\nThe VEX VR Robot is equipped with sensors, controls, and many physical features. In VEXcode VR, there is only one robot, and it is already preconfigured. This eliminates the need for a robot configuration or a predetermined template project.\n\nVR Robot Parts [/hc/article_attachments/360054782392/VR_Robot2_Parts_Callout__1_.jpg]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nROBOT CONTROLS\n\nThe VR Robot has the following controls:\n\n * A drivetrain with a gyro. This enables the “Drivetrain” category of commands in the toolbox of VEXcode VR.\n * An Electromagnet to pick up Disks with Metal Cores.\n * A “pen drawing” feature that allows a pen to be placed up (to not draw) or down (to draw).\n\nscreensensor.png [/hc/article_attachments/8942756117012/screensensor.png]\n\nThe Pen on the VR Robot can be used to:\n\n * Fill an area with color determined using RGB values\n * Set the color of the Pen using RGB values\n * Draw lines at five different widths\n\nFor more information about the Pen on the VR Robot, see this article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/5714438374420-Coding-the-Pen-of-the-VR-Robot-in-Art-Canvas-]\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nROBOT PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES\n\nThe VR Robot has the following physical attributes to scale:\n\n * The wheels are 50mm in diameter.\n * The wheelbase (the distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the back wheel) is approximately 50.8mm.\n * The VR Robot’s length is 133mm.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nROBOT SENSORS\n\nThe VR Robot has the following sensors:\n\n * Motor Encoders that are 360 degrees per wheel revolution.\n * The front facing Eye Sensor also acts like a distance sensor and returns the distance of a detected object in mm and inches.\n * A Gyro Sensor that is built into the Drivetrain. Clockwise is positive.\n   Top-down view of the VEXcode VR robot [/hc/article_attachments/360053683992/VR_TopDownBot01.jpg]\n * Two Eye Sensors, one that faces forward, and the other down. These sensors can detect if there is an object present. If there is, the sensor can also detect the color (red, green, blue, none).\n * A Location Sensor that reads (X,Y) coordinates from the center turning point of the VR Robot.\n\n\n\nFor more information, help, and tips, check out the many resources at VEX Professional Development Plus [https://pd.vex.com/]\n\nLast Updated: August 30, 2022\n\n * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/share.php?title=Understanding+Robot+Features+in+VEXcode+VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360041778591-Understanding-Robot-Features-in-VEXcode-VR]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/share?lang=en&text=Understanding+Robot+Features+in+VEXcode+VR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360041778591-Understanding-Robot-Features-in-VEXcode-VR]\n * LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=VEX+Robotics&title=Understanding+Robot+Features+in+VEXcode+VR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkb.vex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360041778591-Understanding-Robot-Features-in-VEXcode-VR]\n\nInnovation First, International [//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/9417421/862e8d0f47452c217524f1ff033f24a379662980.svg]https://www.innovationfirst.com\n\nEducational content is made freely and publicly available by VEX Robotics, Inc. solely for educational use and may not be reproduced, modified and redistributed without attribution to VEX Robotics.
